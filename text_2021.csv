"Low-cost airline Ryanair has been blown off course by a slew of air traffic control strikes in Europe that forced it to cancel more than 1,000 flights in May.

The Irish-based carrier said more than 200,000 of its 12.5m customers were affected last month after 1,100 flights were cancelled. European air traffic control workers, predominantly in France, went on strike and the shortage of such workers also hindered the carrier.

"Rolls-Royce believes the number of aircraft withdrawn from operations over Trent engine issues is starting to decline, without reaching the manufacturer's peak estimate of 50.

Chief executive Warren East detailed the manufacturer's progress on addressing the problems, focused on Trent 1000 blades for Boeing 787s, during an investor briefing on 15 June.

""We'd anticipated a pretty grim situation with aircraft on the ground,"" says East.

The company ramped up its maintenance capacity in response and trimmed the cycle time for inspections and parts replacement.

East says that the ""bottleneck has shifted"" from MRO capacity to logistics, given the time required for transporting large and heavy items.

He stresses that the aircraft-on-ground figure is ""less than we feared"", adding that it ""never actually hit 50"", and he puts the current level at 44 and falling.

Rolls-Royce has completed the first stage of initial inspections on the Package C version of the Trent 1000. East says the failure rate on repetitive inspections has been better than forecast.

But he also acknowledges that the situation is ""causing a number of our customers a huge amount of disruption"".

The company has embarked on a one-off inspection regime for Package B engines, to gather data.

East says that the ""good news"" is that these powerplants are affected ""much later"" in their life cycle, adding: ""It happens after scheduled maintenance in the main.""

Testing of a new Package C compressor rotor design is ""going well"", says East, and the company is still hoping to bring the implementation of a fix forward to this year, rather than early 2019.

East says turbine blade capacity is a ""limiting factor"" for the company but that it is continuing to improve the situation. Rolls-Royce has increased blade capacity by 50% since the beginning of the year.",Flight Global,0
"On 1 July, Airbus will add two new models to its range when it takes a majority stake in the ­Bombardier CSeries programme.

After years of uncertainty amid Bombardier’s cash constraints, the move will shore up the twinjet family’s finances, as well as adding significant firepower to the sales effort and potentially cutting unit costs.

However, these changes can only do so much to stimulate demand.

Back in 2008 when it launched the Pratt & Whitney PW1500G-powered CS100 and CS300, Bombardier forecast 20-year sales of 6,300 units in the 100-150-seat space. But over the following decade, just 805 deliveries were made into the segment by four airframers.

Nonetheless, Bombardier’s latest 20-year forecast puts demand at an increased 6,800 units.

Nobody disputes that the CSeries pair are excellent aircraft, featuring a host of technological innovations.

However, the type has only sold in limited numbers: Bombardier had accumulated 402 firm orders at the last count, with the majority being for the larger CS300. For that matter, Airbus has sold just 54 units of the competing A319neo.

Together, the partners should be able to take the order total significantly higher than it is at present. But to meet their lofty sales goals, they must breathe life into a space that has so far shown only modest growth.",Flight Global,0
"Rolls-Royce remains confident that the blade durability problems affecting its Trent 1000 engine will not be replicated in its Trent XWB or Trent 7000 powerplants.

The Trent XWB is fitted to the Airbus A350 family while the Trent 7000 has been developed for the A330neo.

Chief executive Warren East expressed caution during an investor briefing on 15 June, admitting that ruling out the possibility of occurrence on the XWB before some 20-30 engines had entered their first shop visit would be ""foolhardy"".

But he stresses that there is ""no evidence"" of similar turbine issues affecting the XWB, pointing out that a different ""design flow"" and more modern tools were used during its development.

The A350 fleet is expanding – a total of 174 had been delivered by the beginning of June – and East says that more inspections of XWBs were being carried out.

But he is confident that the manufacturer is ""not seeing"" early signs of the problems afflicting the Trent 1000.

Rolls-Royce is also optimistic that the Trent 7000, which is derived from the Trent 1000, will be similarly unaffected.

East says that the company is ""not seeing a potential"" for the same issues to arise on the Trent 7000, but will be ""making very certain"" that any improvements to the Trent 1000 are incorporated into the A330neo's engine.

TAP Portugal is set to be the first carrier to operate the A330neo. East puts the entry into service date ""towards the end"" of the third quarter.

"France’s strike-prone and ill-equipped air traffic controllers are responsible for a third of all delays in the skies over Europe, a senate report concluded yesterday.

The delays are costing airlines €300 million (£263m) per year it found.

According to the report, between 2004 and 2016, France’s air traffic controllers were on strike 254 days. That placed them far ahead of second-placed Greece, on only 46 days of stoppages. In third place came Italy 37 with Germany in fourth, according to the report seen by Le Parisien.

"Airbus will begin delivery of A350-900s incorporating a ""wing-twist"" aerodynamic improvement in July when it hands over Iberia's first aircraft of the type.

The wing twist was originally introduced on the A350-1000 and will become standard on all A350s.

Iberia is due to receive its first A350-900 next month

Airbus

Another -1000 improvement – the replacement of titanium passenger-door surrounds with carbonfibre – is being incorporated into all A350s from the first ultra-long-range -900ULR (MSN216). This aircraft, which made its first flight on 23 April, also features the wing twist and is due for delivery to launch customer Singapore Airlines in the second half of 2018.

""These are natural evolutions of a product... Continuous improvement is an Airbus tradition,"" says A350 marketing director Francois Obe.

""What we are doing is taking the lessons from the -1000 and reverting them to the -900. Any innovations on the -1000 are reverted to the -900 so we have a true family.""

Obe says the carbonfibre surrounds are lighter and that the change simplifies the production process.

The ULR incorporates a series of changes to provide additional range including increased operating weights and fuel capacity, along with weight savings. The maximum take-off weight rises to 280t (616,700lb) from the previous highest value of 275t. This increases range by around 1,600nm (3,000km) to 9,700nm.

There are no additional fuel tanks, but Obe explains that Airbus is using part of the existing centre tank's ""empty space"" to increase capacity. This enables the ULR's centre-tank capacity to be raised by around 24,000l over the -900's 140,450l to 165,000l.

"As the worldwide fleet of Boeing 737-200s continues to dwindle, one Canadian operator sees a bright future in the aging twinjet.

Canada's Nolinor Aviation, which operates one of the world's largest 737-200 fleets, is investing C$10 million ($7.6 million) to equip 10 of the 40-year-old aircraft with modern avionics and glass displays.

In doing so, Nolinor seems likely to ensure that at least some 737-200s – a type Boeing first delivered in 1967 – remain flying for decades.

The aircraft's analog indicators and spinning gyroscopes will be replaced by Honeywell and Universal Avionics hardware and systems – a technological refresh enabling Nolinor's 737-200s to fly for another 25 years, the company's maintenance production manager Pierre Dore tells FlightGlobal.

""We are basically ripping the guts out and putting in brand-new, off-the-shelf stuff,"" he says.

Nolinor chose cockpit upgrades over aircraft replacements for a simple reason: 737-200s are approved to operate from gravel runways, Dore says.

""That's why we are still using the old -200s,"" he says. ""Later-generation aircraft are not approved for gravel runway operations.""

Based in Mirabel, near Montreal, Nolinor operates passenger and cargo charters, including flights to Canada's far northern regions for mining companies.

Its fleet includes seven 737-200s, one 737-300, four Convair 580s and Learjets, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer.

Nolinor

Boeing produced about 1,100 Pratt & Whitney JT8D-powered 737-200s until 1988, when it delivered the last of the type.

The fleet has decreased significantly in size since, shrinking to about 900 in-service aircraft in 1998 and 354 in 2008, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.

The fleet fell by one on 18 May when a 737-200 operated by Mexico City-based charter carrier Global Air, also called Damojh, crashed near Havana.

Today, just 77 737-200s remain active, operated by a hodgepodge of 44 carriers in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and North America.

Nolinor operates more 737-200s than any other airline – its seven examples account for a whopping 9% of the fleet, data shows.

Though they are between 34 and 44 years old, nearly all Nolinor's 737-200s have logged less than 50,000 cycles, meaning they can operate at least 20,000 more cycles prior to reaching life limits, says Dore.

Nolinor is upgrading the cockpits of the seven aircraft and another three that have not yet joined the fleet, he says. Mid-Canada Mod Center in Mississauga is performing the work.

One aircraft – registration C-GTUK– has already received its makeover, and a second aircraft will enter the shop in August, Dore says.

The first aircraft has been operating without issue since 31 May.

""Pilots are loving it,"" Dore says.

The aircraft are being fitted with four Universal Avionics' EFI-890R liquid crystal displays. Those displays link with two Honeywell Laseref V inertial navigation systems and two Universal UNS-1Lw flight management systems, says Nolinor.

Though other operators have updated 737-200s with electronic flight instrument systems, Nolinor's aircraft are the first to receive Universal EFI-890R displays, Nore says.

The aircraft will also have automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (out) systems – a requirement for operating in the USA starting in 2020.

In addition, the upgrades will give the 737-200s improved required navigation performance capability, enabling pilots to fly more direct routes, Dore says.

The old avionics, some made by long-defunct systems maker Sperry, are prone to maintenance problems, Dore says. Repairs have been difficult and spare parts have been hard to locate.

The new equipment will improve dispatch reliability and provide pilots with better situational awareness, says Dore, noting that the displays can provide overlays of weather, terrain and other information.

""[Premium Plus] further pushes us down the road as segmentation, particularly with the mid-tier cabin,"" he said at the time. ""We're really confident in its ability to deliver value for the airline.""

United is targeting $1 billion in additional revenue from segmentation, which includes no-frills basic economy fares as well as the new premium-economy cabin, by 2020.

US carriers have long held off on introducing premium economy, instead offering passengers a buy-up to extra-legroom economy seats. American Airlines was the first to offer a dedicated premium-economy product in 2016, followed by Delta Air Lines in 2017.

United initially plans to install Premium Plus on its 767-300ERs, 777-200s and -300ERs, and 787-10s, it said in an employee update earlier this year. It will install 22 of the seats on the 767s, 24 on the 777s and 21 seats on the 787.

For the first state of route-proving, MSN1819 is set to fly on to Brazil, visiting cities including Recife, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Miami.

The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000-powered aircraft took off on 19 June from Toulouse's runway 32R – using a full-thrust departure, rather than a flex setting, on the request of flight-test engineers – for a 1h 30min flight to the Portuguese capital.

MSN1819 had pushed back with just under 20t of fuel, and a weight of 164t, with a projected landing weight of 156.8t. The crew confirmed, after touchdown on Lisbon's on runway 21, that the twinjet had burned 8t of fuel.

The 298-seat aircraft – featuring the airframer's three-class revamped 'Airspace' cabin interior, fitted with Recaro seating – was transporting board members from the carrier and the airframer, as well as government figures and media representatives, FlightGlobal among them.

Route-proving will subsequently take the aircraft to Asia, with stops in Kuala Lumpur and other regional hubs, before it returns to Europe via Mauritius. It also fly to Delhi before heading west again, operating through Reykjavik, Chicago and Atlanta.

The exercise is intended to demonstrate the A330neo's readiness for airline service.

"GE Aviation was unable to identify the cause of a disk web crack that caused a GE90-powered British Airways 777-200 to fail during a takeoff roll on a Las Vegas airport runway nearly three years ago, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says.

Although the NTSB’s 33-month investigation did not identify a root cause for the engine failure, the board’s investigators raised questions about the checklist and steps taken by the crew that may have delayed the evacuation and worsened the fire on the runway.

One crew member suffered a serious injury and 19 passengers reported minor injuries during the 9 September 2015 incident, which involved British Airways flight 66 from Las Vegas to London.

The disk web stage 8-10 inside the high pressure compressor exploded as the aircraft accelerated to take-off. The crew commanded a rejected takeoff procedure within 2s of the engine failure, causing the aircraft to slow to a stop from 77kt within 13s.

An extensive metallurgical examination of the failed component revealed evidence of a sustained-peak low-cycle fatigue crack in the stage 8-10 disk web, but could not determine a root cause, the NTSB says.

The first signs of the crack should have been detectable during a maintenance check in 2008, but there was no requirement to inspect the disk web, the NTSB says. GE now has procedures to check for disk web cracks during routine maintenance, the agency adds.

Boeing told the NTSB that an estimated 436l (97gal) of jet fuel spilled onto the runway at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport. The spill occurred during the 28s between the engine failure and the moment that the crew shut off the fuel valve to the engine, the NTSB says.

The captain called for the engine fire checklist twice before starting the procedure, according to the NTSB’s review of the cockpit voice recorder. About 13s elapsed between the captain’s second call for the checklist and the closure of the fuel valve.

“British Airways' engine fire checklist, which was based on the Boeing 777 engine fire checklist, did not differentiate between an engine fire occurring on the ground or during flight,” the NTSB says.

“The third step of the checklist instructed the flight crew to cut off the fuel control switch on the affected side to shut down that engine,” the agency adds. “However, for an engine fire on the ground, the checklist did not include a step to shut down the unaffected engine or indicate that some steps did not apply.”",Flight Global,1
"Airbus's route-proving network for the A330neo might indicate particular marketing targets for the airframer as it attempts to generate further interest in the re-engined twinjet.

These include Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Reykjavik and Atlanta, respectively hubs for AirAsia X, Garuda Indonesia, Wow Air and Delta Air Lines.

But the inclusion of Hong Kong, Manila and Bangkok on the Asian route-proving exercise could signal additional marketing efforts.

Hong Kong's Cathay Dragon operates some of the oldest A330-300s still in service, including aircraft over 25 years of age.

Manila is a base for Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific. Philippine Airlines is preparing to receive its first A350, set to replace A340s, but the carrier is also an A330 operator, as is Cebu Pacific which uses its A330s in a high-density configuration.

Thai Airways is an A350 and A330 operator but Bangkok is also the base for NokScoot, which has considered the A330neo as a potential successor to its Boeing 777-200ERs.

Airbus declines to comment on specific customer discussions.

But Airbus head of A330 marketing Crawford Hamilton, speaking in Toulouse as the A330neo embarked on its route-proving flights, pointed out that older 777-200ERs, as well as 767s, were among the types Airbus views as targets for replacement with A330neos.

Hamilton says the A330 had a ""bit of weird delivery profile"", with relatively few aircraft delivered over the first few years after its introduction.

But the A330neo will enter service just as A330s begin to reach around 20 years of age, with large numbers reaching this threshold from 2019 onwards.

"Airbus does not foresee a need for a further hike to the maximum take-off weight of the A330neo, following its decision to lift the threshold to 251t.

Its A330neo is currently based on a 242t MTOW airframe introduced in 2015, and the A330-900 has a range of 6,550nm.

Airbus has gradually lifted the MTOW of the A330 since the -300 entered service in 1994 at 212t.

The airframer expects to put the higher-weight version of the A330neo into service in mid-2020, lifting the A330-900's range to 7,200nm.

A330neo programme manager Odile Jubecourt, speaking to FlightGlobal in Toulouse ahead of a route-proving flight to Lisbon, said she did not expect the type to require a further MTOW increase.

""I don't think there is a need to do it,"" she says, adding that, in terms of range, the aircraft already has a ""huge capability"".

But she also points out that the ultimate decision will depend on market demands, and states: ""It will always be in our DNA to look for incremental improvements.""

Jubecourt had previously described the 251t figure as a ""best compromise"" for the A330neo, which is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines.

She also stresses that A330neo testing has not revealed any evidence of problems with the powerplant, despite its design being derived from the Boeing 787's Trent 1000, currently the subject of extensive scrutiny over blade durability.

Jubecourt insists the Trent 7000 is ""different"" powerplant. ""We're very confident about the engines,"" she says, but adds that the company is still co-operating closely with Rolls-Royce given the Trent 1000 situation.

Route-proving is part of the final stages of certification for the A330-900, which is set to enter service with TAP Portugal this summer.

Airbus also intends to start flight-testing the smaller A330-800 this year, says Jubecourt, which will also be offered as a 251t aircraft with a range of 8,150nm.",Flight Global,0
"Pratt & Whitney expects to have rectified issues with the knife edge seals on the in-service fleet of PW1100G geared turbofan engines by the middle of 2019.

In an email to FlightGlobal, P&W's president commercial engines, Chris Calio admits that while it has caught up on replacing faulty seals on new engines, it will still take time for redesigned seals to be fitted to those engines already in service.

""Naturally, there are engines that are flying today which will require time off-wing to install the fixes, so we will continue to witness removal events for these engines. We anticipate resolving these engine removals by mid-2019,"" says Calio.

A new knife edge seal issue was discovered in January after four Airbus A320neos experienced engine shutdowns on take-off or during flight. P&W chief executive Bob Leduc previously said the engine’s original knife edge seal was delivered with a design flaw that required an inspection after a certain interval of flight hours.

A redesigned seal was introduced into the production system late last year, but made the problem worse. Instead of merely an inspection requirement, the new seal caused the engine to shut down.

P&W has since resumed shipments of PW1100Gs to Airbus with a previous design of a knife edge seal that does not have the flaw.

""While admittedly, the issues we have had did cause a delay in deliveries from Airbus, we are now back on track on our deliveries of the GTF engines, and will continue to ramp up in our deliveries commitments,"" adds Calio.

P&W says that it is also ""applying lessons learned in-service"" from the PW1100G-JM and PW1500G engines to the PW1200G that powers the Mitusbishi Aircraft MRJ regional jet.

&W did not specify the cause of the incident. ""We’re able to weave improvements into the still-nascent MRJ production line, and there are development plans in-place to ensure root causes are addressed in the PW1200G programme. The ability to rapidly learn and accelerate improvements across the GTF engine family is a significant advantage,"" explains Calio. The engine manufacturer adds that it is still in discussions with Boeing to explore how best it is able to meet the airframer's specificification and production timelines for its New Mid-market Aircraft (NMA). Calio says that its GTF architecture is scalable “to meet existing and potential customer demands, including but not limited to Boeing’s New Mid-market Airplane.”

"Comac’s two C919 prototypes took to the skies on 22 June, flying more than four hours combined.

The Chinese manufacturer says aircraft 102 departed Shanghai Pudong International airport at 07:13 local time, and flew for 1h 34mins. Aircraft 101 meanwhile took off from Xian Yanliang airport and flew for 3h 10mins.

Both aircraft performed stability tests and also checks on systems.

Comac adds that the narrowbody programme is progressing “steadily as planned”, and that flight tests, static strength tests and ground tests, as well as subsequent optimisation will be carried out “in an orderly manner”.

Aircraft 102 takes off from Shanghai Pudong International airport on 22 June

It adds that aircraft 101 was earlier undergoing modifications and load calibrations in Xian. Changes were made to its counterweight and trailing cone systems. Aircraft 102 has also had its functions and systems checked, together with tests and modifications, and will soon be transferred to the Dongying test base.

The flights of the two aircraft followed a media report that the manufacturer had grounded its two test prototypes for modifications, which will add three months to its flight-test schedule. The report had said that the aircraft were having their tailplanes and flaps modified, due to delamination on the elevators and strength issues respectively.

When contacted, Comac said no aircraft have been grounded and that modifications are part of the flight test process. It adds that no issues have so far come up to affect its schedule and that the programme is progressing steadily. The target is to achieve certification and enter the C919 into service in the 2020-2021 period.

Aircraft 103 is meanwhile undergoing final assembly, with wing to body join already completed. Cables and airborne systems are being installed, and the target remains for the aircraft to take its first flight by the end of the year.

"Bombardier is considering developing a version of its new CRJ Atmosphere cabin for its Q400 turboprop as the company renews its regional aircraft focus, says Bombardier president of commercial aircraft Fred Cromer.

The Canadian manufacturer has been promoting its new CRJ Atmosphere cabin since last year, touting the product as providing a more-comfortable experience for passengers.

""We learned a lot from the Atmosphere cabin. I think there is an opportunity to [apply] that to the Q400,"" Cromer tells reporters on 21 June. ""We'll see if that makes sense from the customer's point of view.""

Cromer made his comments during a media event in Montreal during which he and other executives reviewed the company's strategy post 1 July, when Bombardier expects to close a CSeries deal with Airbus.

With that agreement, which regulators have already approved, Airbus will assume majority ownership of CSeries, leaving Bombardier's commercial division with two aircraft, the Q400 and CRJ series.

Cromer says Bombardier is now doubling its focus on those products.

Last year, Bombardier unveiled the new CRJ Atmosphere cabin, which has larger overhead bins and lavatories and other improvements, the company says.

Bombardier will display its Atmosphere cabin in a CRJ900 in July during the Farnborough air show. The company expects to deliver the first aircraft with the cabin, a CRJ900, to Delta Air Lines this year.",Flight Global,0
"Bombardier has ruled out updating its CRJ line of regional aircraft with currently-available new engines, saying additional weight of new engines would largely erode improvements in engine efficiency.

""The equation is not positive for putting those new engines on the plane,"" Bombardier vice-president and head of marketing Patrick Baudis says on 21 June. ""Today, we think we have the right engine on that platform.""

Questions have persisted for several years about whether Bombardier will equip CRJs with new engines in a move to modernise the regional jet and to improve fuel efficiency.

Observers have suggested that a modified version of GE Aviation's Passport engine could do the job.

GE CF34 engines now power the CRJ line, which includes the CRJ700, CRJ900 and CRJ1000.

Such a move would follow a path struck by Bombardier's prime competitor in the regional aircraft business Embraer.

That company is updating its E-Jets with a host of design changes, including a new wing and Pratt & Whitney PW1700G and PW1900G geared turbofans. The result is Embraer's E2 line of aircraft.

But new-generation engines weigh more than older engines – weight that translates into increased fuel, Baudis notes.

""They bring better fuel efficiency, but it comes with a weight cost. You bring additional cost because you have bigger engines,"" he says.

Baudis insists that on short regional routes the new engines' efficiency gains do not adequately overcome the combination of the weight penalty and the expense of certifying a re-engined CRJ.

""It does not make sense based on a fuel-burn basis because there is not enough flight time to recover the additional weight you put on the airplane,"" Baudis says.

The heavier engines on Embraer' E-Jet E2s are among reasons why the E175-E2 has a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 44,800kg (98,767lb).

That weight has effectively placed E175-E2s beyond reach of the US regional carriers that operate aircraft for major US airlines.

Those regional airlines largely cannot buy aircraft that have MTOW of more than 39,010kg due to so-called ""scope"" restrictions in the contracts between major US airlines and their pilots.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus has emphasised that disruption to its aircraft production model critically depends on smooth and integrated operational flow, and has outlined the substantial measures it would need to adopt to protect that flow should the UK withdraw from the European Union without an adequate trade agreement.

Exiting from the EU single market and customs union would interrupt the flow of parts to Airbus's production centres, meaning that the airframer would need to store some €1 billion worth of stock as a buffer – at a time when production ramp-up plans are testing suppliers' manufacturing capacity.

Airbus is aiming to increase the monthly production rate of its short- and medium-haul A320 family to 60 aircraft next year, and the company is carrying out studies into rates of 70 or more. The company's long-haul aircraft strategy is focused on the A350 which is also approaching an output rate of 10 per month.

Even if Airbus finds the capacity to build a stockpile of spares, it indicates that this line of defence would only offer a degree of resistance to an interruption of production.

""Despite the incremental stocks, the disruptions in a 'no-deal Brexit' situation are likely to add up to several weeks,"" it says.

""With no spare capacity left over years to come, every disruption to production would most likely turn into an unrecoverable delay.""

Airbus's commercial aircraft revenues last year amounted to nearly €51 billion, and that this turnover – amounting to roughly €1 billion per week – could potentially be lost if it is unable to maintain deliveries. The airframer would suffer additional costs from contractual penalties to customers and production inefficiencies, and an impact to its working capital.

The strict regulations which govern aircraft production also mean that, in the absence of a post-Brexit EU trade agreement, UK aerospace suppliers would lose crucial approvals from the European Aviation Safety Agency.

""Should a single supplier not be certified, its parts cannot be installed,"" warns Airbus, pointing out that the UK has 4,000 suppliers responsible for providing over 10,000 original components – and that the inability to install even relatively minor parts can potentially block the delivery of an aircraft.

Loss of EASA jurisdiction would force UK aerospace companies to transfer regulatory design, production and maintenance approvals to the EU in order to retain critical certification. Airbus says that the supply chain must be ""duly prepared"" for the possibility of this scenario.

Withdrawal from the EU without a post-Brexit agreement would spur Airbus to rethink its dependency on the UK's contribution to its activities – including its strategy of concentrating wing production and development in the country.

UK facilities have been assigned the high-profile role of exploring material, manufacturing and assembly techniques for future wing manufacture, but this would also be threatened in a no-deal scenario.

Airbus describes such an outcome as ""catastrophic"" for the company. ""It would impair our ability to benefit from highly qualified British resources,"" it says. ""It would also severely undermine UK efforts to keep a competitive and innovative aerospace industry, while developing high value jobs and competencies.""",Flight Global,0
"As Airbus enters the home straight on the A330neo, everything appears to be running smoothly, with the type nearing certification.

Performance is on spec, the airframer insists, and it has now embarked on an 18-day route-proving effort with the re-engined twinjet.

However, simply referring to the 16-city trip as route-proving hardly does it justice: the airframer has clearly chosen the destinations with care in order to maximise marketing potential for the type.

And well it might – as the re-engining programme approaches the fourth anniversary of its launch at the Farnborough air show in 2014, just 214 orders have been booked for the -900, while the backlog on the smaller -800 has slowly evaporated to nothing.

Of course, all aircraft reach a certain point in their gestation where operators are happier to wait for the surety of certification and real-world operating metrics before putting their money down.

Aside from any doubts over the market’s so far cool reception to the programme, Airbus has a separate concern with the most crucial part of the A330neo – its Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines.

Delays to those powerplants are responsible for the type’s belated service entry – deliveries were originally intended to begin in late 2017 – and now potential reliability issues are an additional headache that Airbus could do without. Both the airframer and R-R insist that the durability shortfall seen on the Trent 1000 for the Boeing 787 will not be replicated on other Trent-series engines.

But almost 50 Dreamliners have been grounded as the UK engine manufacturer scrambles to implement a fix to the intermediate-pressure compressor: a problem that came on top of earlier glitches experienced with the powerplant.

In the meantime, the sight of all those 787s sitting on the tarmac while the engine issue remains unresolved is unlikely to persuade wavering would-be customers to commit to the A330neo, however unlikely that the fault is replicated on the Trent 7000.

At the end of May, Airbus held total orders for 332 A330s, including those for the re-engined variant – or around six and a half years of production.

That is a not insignificant total, of course, but ­Airbus will be crossing multiple digits and hoping that it has not misread the replacement cycle – and that the decision not to offer an alternative engine choice does not backfire.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus's latest risk assessment of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union could still create short-term production disruption even if it takes place with a trade and transition agreement in place.

The airframer says that, even under this orderly withdrawal scenario, additional costs of trade procedures alone could cost its UK-related aerospace network up to €1 billion per year, based on an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study.

Airbus adds that this increased cost, along with airworthiness considerations and labour movement are ""critical issues"" for the company.

Harmonisation of the regulatory framework, and clarity over the customs union, are crucial to Airbus's decision strategy regarding investment in the UK.

""They need to be addressed urgently,"" says the company.

While an orderly 'Brexit', featuring a post-withdrawal agreement and transition period, would be a ""much better outcome"" than an alternative no-deal scenario, Airbus says it would still entail a ""significant amount of risk"" and be ""difficult to manage"".

It believes the current transition period, running to December 2020, is too short for both the governments involved and for Airbus, which needs to reach new adjustment agreements with its UK suppliers.

""The necessary change from an old to new framework contains inherent risks for all involved elements like data, systems [and] supplier readiness,"" it says.

""It is likely that short-term production disruptions of one or two weeks may occur post-transition due to the supply ecosystem not [being] fully ready.""

Airbus says it needs to monitor carefully any new investment in the UK and ""refrain"" from extending its UK supplier base until it understands the nature of the future UK-EU relationship.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus has again warned that the UK's withdrawal from the European Union could lead to a rethink of its UK investment strategy and its presence in the country.

The airframer had strongly backed the UK's remaining a member of the EU before the 'Brexit' referendum in 2016, previously noting that a vote to leave would prompt the company to review the long-term position regarding its UK operations.

Since the vote to leave the EU, Airbus chief operating officer Tom Williams has warned against the risk of disruption to its manufacturing model, especially if the UK withdraws without a future EU trade agreement in place.

Williams insists that Brexit ""in any scenario"" has ""severe negative consequences"" for the UK's aerospace industry – and for Airbus in particular. The airframer is publishing a new assessment outlining the risks to its business.

""Immediate mitigation measures would need to be accelerated,"" says Williams. ""While Airbus understands that the political process must go on, as a responsible business we require immediate details on the pragmatic steps that should be taken to operate competitively.

""Without these, Airbus believes that the impacts on our UK operations could be significant.""

Even if a withdrawal agreement is reached with the EU, Airbus believes the transition period – set to end in December 2020 – is too short for the airframer to adjust arrangements with its supply chain, and that this could restrict Airbus's UK investments.

But Williams adds that the uncertainty of the situation, and the possibility of exiting both the EU single market and its customs union, is a ""dawning reality"" for the company.

Such an outcome, says Airbus, would force it to reconsider its ""long-term footprint"" in the country, where the wings of its commercial aircraft are produced. ""Put simply, a 'no deal' scenario directly threatens Airbus's future in the UK,"" says Williams.",Flight Global,1

This follows a memorandum of understanding signed in March 2017 and a cooperation agreement signed in December 2017 between the two parties to explore the setting up of such a facility.

The facility will offer heavy maintenance and line services for all widebody aircraft types, including Boeing aircraft. The complex will also have repair shops for composite structures, as well as a training centre.

“Thai and Airbus have undertaken extensive studies to validate the business plan for this exciting project,” says Usanee Sangsingkeo, acting president of Thai Airways International. “We are confident that this venture will bring significant economic benefit for Thai and will be a major driver in the development of the wider aerospace sector in Thailand.”

Thai Airways’ MRO arm, Thai Technical, previously told FlightGlobal that it hopes to incorporate the MRO joint venture by the first quarter of 2020, for launch in 2022 - a timeline echoed by Airbus.

Thai Technical’s director of MRO strategy and business development Wilarp Thonglaxsanawong said that the company forecasts that the facility can generate $86 million annually after 10 years, and $629 million annually by 2072, a half century after operations begin.

"Boeing has unveiled a concept for a passenger-carrying version of a futuristic hypersonic military aircraft design that emerged a year ago.

The release of the new concept image at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics-sponsored Aviation conference in Atlanta on 26 June comes about 18 months after Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg predicted hypersonic airliners would be available in “the next decade or two”.

Most definitions of hypersonic speed start at Mach 5.0, or roughly eight times the cruise speed of most modern airliners.

The concept represents a vision for a vehicle that may be possible in 20-30 years, Boeing says.

“We envision this to fly at the highest speed of Mach 5,” Boeing tells FlightGlobal.

Boeing declines to share such details as potential seating capacity and range of the concept, saying such parameters remain speculative at this point.

“One big reason we don’t have this quite yet is that we still have many technical and regulatory challenges to overcome before we make hypersonic flight a reality, not to mention the market that needs to develop to make a business case for the average person to be able to afford hypersonic flight,” Boeing says.

The concept follows a long tradition of aircraft companies releasing highly ambitious, long-term design concepts meant to inspire the public and attract young engineers seeking the most challenging assignments.

It also follows decades of Boeing research and development into hypersonic techonology. Within the last 15 years, they company has built and flown a hydrogen-powered research vehicle at nearly Mach 10 and a jet fuel-propelled experimental missile at speeds up to Mach 5.

More recently, Boeing has participated in the joint US-Australian HiFire 4 programme to develop a hypersonic missile. The company’s venture capital arm, HorizonX, last year invested in UK-based Reaction Engines, which aims to develop a Mach 5 hypersonic aircraft capable of carrying passengers.

“While we are not currently building a hypersonic aircraft, our advanced concepts in conjunction with our efforts to develop enabling technology position us for the time when customers and markets are ready to reap the benefits of hypersonic flight,” Boeing says.",Flight Global,1

"Airbus's warning over its UK investment strategy, given the uncertainty of the future UK-European Union relationship, has prompted the government's business secretary to insist that an agreement suitable for the airframer is possible.

Faced with multiple questions over Airbus's concerns during a 25 June hearing in Parliament, business and industry secretary Greg Clark largely kept his responses centred on two central tenets – that Airbus's views should naturally be considered, and that the government was aiming to secure a future agreement which satisfied the needs of aerospace firms.

Airbus was ""entitled to be listened to with respect"", he said, adding that the government's intention is to secure a post-Brexit deal which will ensure that UK-manufactured products can be approved for use across Europe, with no ""unnecessary friction"", and allow skilled personnel to work across the multiple sites of an integrated operation.

Challenged that Airbus – if faced with new tariff barriers, customs procedures or regulatory divergence – could redirect investment outside the UK, to the EU or China, Clark retorted that he was ""more optimistic"" than some of his Conservative party colleagues over the prospects of a deal to avoid such a situation.

""The task before us is to make an agreement that implements [the decision to leave the EU] and which, at the same time, ensures that these avoidable threats of frictions and tariffs do not take place,"" he said.

""That is absolutely within our grasp and it is what [all parliamentary parties] should back during the months ahead.""

Clark also suggested that Airbus's concerns had been directed not just at the UK government but also the negotiators on the EU side, and stated that he hoped the airframer's message ""will be heard in Brussels"".

Airbus has warned that it faces serious disruption to its production line if the UK withdraws from the EU single market and customs union without a deal that leaves its supply chain uninterrupted.

Clark said the UK-EU talks were moving away from terms of withdrawal and towards the future economic partnership.

""We are negotiating and setting out what we want to achieve through that, and this was always the time when that would be done,"" he said.

""For evidence from Airbus and other companies to come forward at this time is to be expected, given the focus of the discussions over the weeks ahead.""

Clark refused to be drawn into condemnation of Airbus's warnings – disagreeing when one colleague suggested Airbus was making ""ridiculous threats"", and pointing out that companies should contribute to informed discussion. He also brushed aside scepticism of the government's ambitions for a UK-EU trade relationship.

Conservative pro-Brexit member Iain Duncan Smith noted the Airbus already operated outside of the EU, with its Chinese plants, while pro-Brexit colleague John Redwood argued that Boeing's investment in UK manufacturing showed that a complex supply chain could be run outside of the EU and ""[gave] the lie"" to any suggestion that the UK would not be able to continue supplying wings to Airbus.

""Given that our parts go backwards and forwards between the UK and the continent,"" replied Clark, ""if we can avoid frictions, as I am certain we can, that enhances our ability to compete, which is to the advantage of Boeing as well as any other company in the industry.""

Conservative member of parliament Mark Francois queried whether Airbus would really contemplate transferring its wing work to other facilities, such as Toulouse or Hamburg, given the expense and the scale of its investment in the UK.

Clark responded by describing this view as ""too pessimistic"", adding: ""We do not want Airbus to be located in this country because it is too difficult for the company to go elsewhere.

""We want it to be here with enthusiasm because this is a good and profitable place to invest. I am determined that the [post-Brexit] deal we secure and the investment we make through our industrial strategy will add to our strengths and make us even more attractive.""",Flight Global,0
"Delta Air Lines and Boeing have discussed the possibility of the carrier launching the proposed New Mid-market Airplane (NMA), as Delta seeks a replacement for more than 100 ageing mid-market aircraft.

""We've had discussions with Boeing about being a potential launch customer,"" says Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta, at the National Press Club in Washington DC today.

While Bastian uses the past tense to describe the launch customer discussions, which likely occurred during meetings he had with Boeing in March, he explains that Delta cannot commit to ordering the NMA until Boeing's board decides to build the aircraft. Until then, the airframer and Delta are in the ""discussions phase"", he says.

In addition, any launch order will depend on the final parameters of the NMA, says Bastian.

The NMA family will seat 220-270 passengers with a range of roughly 5,000nm (9,260km) when it enters service, which Boeing forecasts by 2025. The airframer aims to achieve trip costs roughly 40% better than current generation widebodies, like the 767.

Delta would order the NMA as a successor to its Boeing 757-300s that seat 234 passengers, and 767s that seat 208-261 passengers, says Bastian. Both aircraft types are scheduled for retirement in the next decade.

The airline operates 16 757-300s with an average age of 15.4 years, and 79 767s with an average age of 21 years, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows. It operates both 767-300ER and 767-400ER variants.

LAUNCH BREAK

The idea that Delta could launch the NMA is one of the more significant breaks by Bastian from his predecessor Richard Anderson. Anderson, who led the airline from 2007 to 2016, publicly eschewed new technology aircraft, calling the risks too great compared to the benefits of lower capital cost existing technology.

“My balance sheet is not equipped to take [airframers'] technical risk,"" he said on the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 in an interview with Airline Business in 2014. ""Once those airplanes are proven, then we’ll be in a position to be able to operate them.”

For example, US Boeing 787 launch operator United Airlines was impacted in the multi-month grounding of the type in 2013 due to battery issues. The Chicago-based carrier's then-chief executive Jeff Smisek called the aircraft a ""fairly expensive piece of sculpture to have on the ground"", though he did not provide a number for what the grounding cost United beyond that it was forced to postpone a number of route launches.

United is also interested in the NMA, though executives have not expressed an interest in launching the programme.

Since 2014, Delta has ordered the A350 and Bombardier CSeries, though deliveries of both occurred – or will occur – years after the respective launch operators took the first models.

Bastian hopes Boeing will take the lessons it learned from the 787, which in addition to the battery issues was delivered years late, and apply them to the NMA.

This includes the question whether the engine manufacturers are able to meet the 2025 entry-into-service target, as they continue to face issues meeting delivery timelines for current aircraft programmes. Engine technology is critical to the NMA meeting its efficiency targets.

CFM International, Pratt and Whitney (P&W) and Rolls-Royce are all competing to supply engines to the NMA. P&W plans a scaled-up version of its geared turbofan (GTF) and Rolls-Royce the so-called UltraFan with a reduction gear.

Delta and P&W recently signed an agreement for the airline's MRO division Delta TechOps to be the exclusive maintenance provider for the GTF engines on the Airbus A320neo family and CSeries in the Americas.

As Boeing finalises the NMA, Delta's biggest consideration on a possible launch order will be getting the ""cheapest price possible"", says Bastian - maintaining a sentiment frequently espoused by his former boss.

"Ten years ago, Bombardier shifted away from regional aircraft when it launched the CSeries, a move executives said would enable it to tap into a larger-aircraft market they viewed as otherwise ignored.

But with the transfer of the CSeries to Airbus planned for 1 July, Bombardier returns to familiar ground, focusing again on the regional aircraft that defined the company before the CSeries.

Bombardier's executives describe the transition as an opportunity, citing rising demand for regional aircraft and a recent uptick in Q400 sales. They insist their CRJs, even without engine upgrades, remain efficient and competitive – particularly in the USA.

""With the CSeries moving to Airbus control – that does free up our ability to re-energise, refocus on the regional market,"" says Bombardier president of commercial aircraft Fred Cromer. ""We are in transition mode.""

Speaking to reporters during a press event at Mirabel International airport in Quebec, Cromer says Bombardier never ignored regional aircraft while it developed the CSeries. But the high-profile CSeries programme did overshadow the company's regional aircraft product improvements and sales successes, he says.

Cromer aims now to highlight that progress.

""Behind the scenes, we have been equally focused on our regional jet programme,"" Cromer says. ""The product we are producing today is a very different product than we produced years ago.""

The company estimates airlines worldwide will need 5,750 aircraft in the 60- to 100-seat range in the next 20 years, with North American carriers set to take the lion's share in the form of 1,400 aircraft, according to Bombardier's most recent fleet forecast.

""I think we should be targeting 50% [of that market],"" Cromer says.

The 60- to 100-seat segment includes Q400s and the CRJ NextGen line-up of CRJ700s, CRJ900s and CRJ1000s. Other competitors include Embraer 175s and E190s, ATRs and Mitsubishi Aircraft MRJs.

In addition to targeting sales, Bombardier will put more emphasis on sales of aftermarket services. It will attempt to more closely link aftermarket offerings with aircraft sales and will continue to earn revenue from aftermarket services provided to the CSeries programme.

""Our focus is going to be on aftermarket equally to selling new airplanes,"" Cromer says.

Since delivering the first CRJ700 in 2001, Bombardier has sold 899 CRJ NextGens, nearly 600 of which have gone or will go to US airlines, according to the company and Flight Fleets Analyzer. Bombardier has unfilled orders for 67 CRJs.

Operators worldwide have bought about 635 Q400s, of which about 60 remain in Bombardier's backlog, data shows.

Prime competitor Embraer has sold more E-Jets, though Embraer's products do occupy a slightly different market – E-Jets range between about 70 and 146 seats. As of the end of March, Embraer had sold 1,835 E-Jets, including a backlog of 421, the Brazilian company reported.

ATR has also had notable success, having sold some 750 of its newer ATR 42-600s and ATR 72-600s, Fleets Analyzer shows. ATR has 264 aircraft on back order.

Orders for regional jets have slowed in recent years, but Bombardier's executives describe their products as on an upswing.

They note product improvements and recent sales, including orders this year from American Airlines for 15 CRJ900s and from Delta Air Lines for 20 CRJ900s.

""Our backlogs are getting stronger and stronger. We see a very bright future for both the Q400 and the CRJ,"" Cromer says.

The company last year unveiled the Atmosphere CRJ cabin, which has larger overhead bins, entranceways and lavatories, and LED lighting and in-seat power – changes aimed at making the cabin more comfortable.

""The atmosphere cabin is addressing the comfort side,"" says Cromer. ""The CRJ, I think, has a lot of opportunity in the USA.""

Indeed, US airlines operate more CRJs than airlines in any country – about 900 of the 1,400 CRJs in service worldwide, Fleets Analyzer shows.

Bombardier says it has improved the CRJ's fuel efficiency by 6.5% since 2010, thanks to tweaks that have included a different exhaust nozzle.

""What we are hearing from the airlines is that the airplane is still very cost competitive,"" Cromer says of CRJs. ""It's one of the lowest-cost tools that they have, if you look at trip cost.""

Executives insist Bombardier has no intention to replace the CRJ's General Electric CF34 turbofans with more-modern engines – at least not with the state of current technology.

New engines weigh more, and efficiency benefits do not adequately overcome weight penalties on short flights regional airlines typically operate, says Bombardier vice-president and head of marketing Patrick Baudis.

""It does not make sense… on a pure fuel burn basis because there is not enough flight time to recover the amount of weight you put on it,"" he says.

That calculation – not so-called ""scope clause"" restrictions in US airlines' pilot contracts – undergird Bombardier's decision not to re-engine, Baudis adds.

Scope clauses largely prohibit airlines' regional partners from operating aircraft with maximum take-off weights of more than 39,010kg (86,000lb). The heavier E175-E2 exceeds that limit, effectively shutting it out of the world's largest market.

""Whether there is a scope clause or not, the economics are the same. We still end up with a better plane,"" Baudis says.

Bombardier has about doubled its Q400 backlog in one year, thanks to orders from Ethiopian Airlines, Philippine Airlines, India's SpiceJet, a company affiliated with TAAG Angola Airlines and others. Bombardier also now sells 90-seat Q400s, which cost 15% less per seat than 78-seaters, Bombardier notes.

Those sales reflect airlines' increasing need for fast turboprops that can more easily integrate with jet aircraft networks, says Baudis.

Ethiopian Airlines and its partners operate 22 Q400s, and Ethiopian has orders for another 11 of the type

Bombardier

Cromer suggests Bombardier might soon offer an Atmosphere cabin for the Q400.

""I think there are opportunities to [apply] that to the Q400,"" he says. ""We are committed to the Q400 long term.""

Though Bombardier has said little about what other changes lie ahead, Cromer insists the company ""will not be sitting still"".

""We can't just be static and assume the same product we produce today will be the same product we will produce 20 years from now,"" he says.

But the future remains uncertain, and questions about Q400 production resurfaced this year when Bombardier sold its Downsview site in Toronto, home to the Q400 assembly line.

The operation can remain at the site for five more years, but Bombardier eventually intends to move production elsewhere. Observers have speculated that work could move outside Canada, but Bombardier has released no details.

""It presents an opportunity for us to think about where we are going to build that aircraft going forward,"" Cromer says. ""We have an opportunity to… think of lower-cost opportunities.""",Flight Global,0
"For an old airliner, the Boeing 757-200 operated by Honeywell as a flying testbed is enjoying a remarkable second career. Delivered new to Eastern Airlines in February 1983, it was the fifth 757 to be produced.

Initially registered as N504EA in its Eastern days, it then had stints in storage and with UK charter operator MyTravel Airways. It was obtained by Honeywell in 2005. After extensive modifications, it returned to service in 2008, now bearing the registration N757HW.

Joe Duval, who leads Honeywell’s flight-test department, says the aircraft is ""the only 757 in the world with three engines"". That is a slight bending of the truth. Unless the aircraft's universal test pylon - located on the upper fuselage on the right-hand side of the aircraft forward of the wing - is occupied, it very much remains a twinjet. Still, the testbed makes for a unique sight lined up with the 777s and Airbus A330s at Singapore's Changi airport.

FlightGlobal was lucky enough to join a test flight from Changi. Although the 757 bristles with new systems and avionics, we wondered if any vestiges of its former Eastern career remained. Lead test pilot Jason McMahon pointed out a modest button labelled T/O CHK, above and to the right of the old-school mechanical altimeter. Pressed immediately before departure, the Take-Off Configuration Check button will alert the crew if there is something amiss with flaps, control surfaces, and other systems. McMahon says Eastern had the only 757s equipped with this feature.

The cockpit is a curious mix of mechanical instruments – altimeter, attitude indicator, airspeed indicator – and digital screens – namely an advanced radar display. Mounted at eye level between the two pilots is an iPad electronic flightbag. In a commercial airliner, data available on the iPad, such as a strategic weather picture and a moving map, would probably be shown on multifunction displays – if not on paper, depending on the age of the jet. Since N757HW is classified as an experimental aircraft, the crew has more liberal options for the use of such devices.

GAUGING WEATHER

Usually based in the USA, the 757 is in the Asia-Pacific for a month, mainly to coincide with the region’s monsoon season – ""chasing storms"" as McMahon puts it. Among other missions, the aircraft is gathering data for Honeywell’s Intuvue 3D weather hazard and avoidance system. This involves flights over the Andaman and South China Seas, preferably during inclement weather. Later this year, the aircraft will also perform radar calibration flights in Europe and the USA.

While the aircraft's RDR-4000 radar is a mature technology, Honeywell has a long-term project to keep refining how the software that powers Intuvue interprets weather. To do this, cameras in the cockpit record data appearing on aircraft displays, while a powerful sensor on the jet’s right-side pylon detects air and water molecules. The objective is to ensure the radar is calibrated to show the real picture in front of the aircraft.

The main cabin of the 757 is spartan: crew amenities are limited to a big box of instant noodles and cartons of bottled water located in the rear of the fuselage. Apart from a few rows of passenger seats, the cabin is dominated by 16 equipment bays, which can provide displays for engineers, or be used to house other equipment.

When an engine is being tested, there will typically be five engineers on board, while avionics tests usually involve two or three personnel. For the sake of efficiency, it is preferable to conduct work on more than one system during flights.

CONNECTED

Despite the stripped-back cabin, there is one area where the aircraft reigns supreme in passenger comfort, however: onboard wi-fi. The aircraft’s JetWave high-speed communications system enabled a dozen journalists to conduct crystal-clear WhatsApp video calls or live stream from the flight. Indeed, Honeywell dubs the jet the “Connected Aircraft”.

Still, the aircraft retains a distinctly old-school feel. In the rear of the cabin is a modest piece of aviation history: an original trailing static cone reel from the early days of the 757 programme. Honeywell acquired it from Boeing at the same time as it bought the twinjet. It is used to reel out a trailing cone to measure static air pressure during test flights.

The aircraft's current tour of the Asia-Pacific region involves stops in Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Vietnam. But a constant challenge for Duval and McMahon is coping with local authorities that are not used to dealing with experimental aircraft.

McMahon says that a flight in the USA that would be relatively simple from a regulatory perspective can be quite challenging in other jurisdictions. Indeed, Changi controllers delayed the Singapore flight for nearly 1h owing to paperwork issues. A cause of particular consternation among the region's air traffic controllers is the idea that a jet can leave from a given airport and then return to the same site.

""We’re also a big plane,"" says McMahon. ""This can make it hard for them to squeeze us into a slot.""",Flight Global,0

"Airbus had been a vocal opponent of UK withdrawal from the European Union, long before the referendum that sealed the decision to leave, so its agitation over the absence of a post-Brexit agreement is hardly a surprise.

For an organisation skilled in diplomacy, necessitated by tensions between its French and German power bases, Airbus's latest portent over the consequences of Brexit uncertainty – delivered by its candid Glaswegian chief operating officer – is uncharacteristically frank.

But whether anyone in government really believes that Airbus's rethink of future UK investment would extend to implementing the nuclear option – a manufacturing pull-out, and transfer of its wing work elsewhere – is unclear.

Certainly a number of parliamentarians are sceptical, not least the representative for Airbus's own Filton neighbourhood, Jack Lopresti, who described Airbus's threats as ""ridiculous"" during a jousting session in the wake of the airframer's statements.

Business secretary Greg Clark adopted a more conciliatory position during the debate, accepting that the government needed to listen to the views of Airbus and other companies, but giving little visibility on the state of negotiations and whether, outside of the wish-list, the aim of a frictionless UK-EU trade regime was realistic.

Airbus's production lines run on a just-in-time concept, with parts arriving only when required. While this has cost and efficiency benefits, the lack of a stockpile means the strategy is vulnerable to supply-chain disruption.

Several countries outside the EU maintain smooth supply to Airbus, but this misses the point. Airbus's apprehension is being stirred not by the presence, or otherwise, of the EU flag on its suppliers' factories, but by the predictability of the situation at the EU border.

The prospect of Airbus taking drastic action to preserve its operational model is not as remote a possibility as some parliamentarians might feel comfortable believing. Airbus has previously indicated that China would be keen to take more wing work, and the airframer's establishment of new final assembly lines – the most recent in Hamburg, a week before its Brexit warning – illustrate the speed with which it can set up high-tech manufacturing stations.

To escape the jaws of a lion, you don't need to run faster than the lion. You only need to run faster than your slowest companion. Airbus's shifting its presence out of the UK would doubtless be expensive. But such a move does not have to be cheap. It only has to be cheaper than Brexit.",Flight Global,0

"A new defect found within the compressor of the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G will require airlines to replace a part on about 189 engines, the company confirms to FlightGlobal.

But the replacement procedure should not result in aircraft being taken out of service before scheduled shop visits, P&W says.

The new directive issued by the US FAA on 28 June also shouldn’t jeopardise P&W’s plan to ramp up deliveries of the PW1100G to Airbus to support A320neo production, the company says.

“The engines will incorporate the needed change as part of a planned shop visit in the future to replace other life-limited parts on the engine,” P&W says.

The replacement order affects the front hub on the high pressure compressor of the PW1100G engine, the FAA says.

An operator reported finding a damaged hub and an inspection revealed corrosion, the FAA says.

If not replaced, the corrosion could lead the front hub to fail, potentially causing the engine to shutdown in flight, the FAA adds.

The FAA released the directive only two days after calling for one-time, visual inspections on another part in the PW1100G. On 26 June, the FAA called on airlines to inspect the fan hub for damage within 120 days of 11 July.

That directive was issued after an operator reported finding a damaged fan hub during a shop visit. An investigation traced the cause to the installation of the inlet cone without alignment pins.",Flight Global,1

"Airbus and Bombardier have confirmed the closing of the CSeries transaction, giving the European airframer a majority stake in the programme.

Airbus now owns 50.01% in CSeries Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP), Bombardier 34%, and Investissement Quebec 16%, say the two parties.

In addition, Bombardier has issued Airbus warrants that can be exercised for 100 million Class B shares. These have an exercise price of C$2.29 ($17.4), says Bombardier. These are exercisable for five years.

In early June, Airbus said that all regulatory approvals required have been obtained. Bombardier will fund the cash shortfall of the joint venture for up to a maximum of $225 million during the second half of 2018, up to $350 million in 2019, and up to a maximum aggregate of $350 million over the following two years. This will give the Canadian manufacturer non-voting participation shares with cumulative annual dividends of 2%.

The partnership’s head office, leadership team and primary final assembly will still be located in Montreal Mirabel. The parties also expect increased demand to support a second CSeries final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama, aimed at supplying US-based customers.

Airbus's deal gives the airframer two products – the CS300 and A319neo – serving the 130-150-seat segment of the single-aisle market, while also extending its portfolio to the 100-seat segment with the CS100.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus has formally added the Bombardier CSeries to its portfolio of commercial aircraft, for now retaining the CS100 and CS300 identities.

The European airframer is listing the 130- to 140-seat CS300 as having a range of 3,300nm (6,112km) while the CS100, typically seating 120, has a range of 3,100nm.

Its online commercial aircraft product pages have been updated to include detailed technical information for the CSeries although the accompanying illustrations still show the jets in Bombardier colours.

The airframer has yet to disclose whether it will adopt a new brand or designation for the CS100 and CS300.

Airbus is intending to hold a pre-Farnborough briefing, centred on its aircraft family, at its Toulouse headquarters on 10 July.

Bombardier, in turn, has redirected its CSeries online pages to Airbus and its own commercial aircraft site features only the CRJ family and Q400 turboprop.

Airbus closed its transaction to acquire just over 50% of the CSeries Aircraft Limited Partnership on 1 July.",Flight Global,0
"Back before Bombardier bet the farm on the CSeries, its interest in commercial aviation was confined to regional aircraft.

With the CRJ family and Q400 twin-turboprop, the airframer had carved out a modest niche.

But with the 1 July transfer of a majority stake in the CSeries to Airbus, Bombardier finds itself back to square one. The Canadian airframer is talking up the prospects for both its remaining types, but this is ­clearly making a virtue out of a necessity.

Crucially, Bombardier is not proposing major ­upgrades for either aircraft: its ambition appears limited to cabin improvements, rather than changes to their airframes or engines.

But disruption is coming to the sector. New entrants, potentially including Embraer with a turboprop, along with the likely arrival of electric or hybrid propulsion, present a huge challenge to manufacturers unwilling or unable to invest.

Both types are still selling, although not in any great quantity: prior to two recent US deals, the backlog for the CRJ family had stood at just 36 units.

If the future of the two product lines is finite, then Bombardier has some tough decisions to make: after the CSeries, how much does it want to remain in ­commercial aviation? And would it, or its shareholders, be willing to pay to do so?",Flight Global,0
"Sukhoi's civil aircraft division is forecasting sales of 345 Superjet 100s, including the business-jet version, over the period to 2030

Most of these aircraft will be sold in Russia and the former Soviet states, the airframer expects, as well as south-east Asia and Latin America.

Sukhoi Civil Aircraft has given the estimate in its latest annual report.

President Alexander Rubtsov tells FlightGlobal that he is expecting a ""significant volume"" of sales on the local market, and a ""few more deals"" involving exports. Geopolitical pressures are not a issue, he claims.

""The main drivers are technical and economical,"" he says. ""We didn't see too much concern [from customers] about politics.""

But the company is engaged in a substitution programme to swap out parts which, under US restrictions, limit the type's export potential.

Rubtsov also states that Sukhoi intends to double the amount of Russian content in the aircraft, to around 30%.

Sukhoi is expecting to produce around 30 Superjets this year, a similar figure to 2017. Half of last year's aircraft, according to its figures, were produced in the fourth quarter.

The airframer is continuing to refine the Superjet 100, with developments including its 'sabrelet' wing-tips, intended to improve fuel-burn by 3%,

Sukhoi has been concentrating on modifications to take the aircraft's capacity to 110 seats, and its operating environment up to airport altitudes of 4,000m and temperatures of 50C.

It also refers to a cargo version and range improvements to the business-jet variant – as well as the planned development of a shrunk 75-seat model.

"Oman Air has put into revenue service its latest Boeing 787-9 – the first configured with a three-class interior.

For its commercial debut, the widebody was flown from Muscat to London Heathrow on 1 July.

The twinjet's first-class cabin has eight suites, each featuring 180-degree flat-bed seats (below) and a sliding door for added privacy.

All photos: James Mellon/FlightGlobal

All 24 business-class seats (below) are arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration and have direct aisle access. The 232 economy seats, meanwhile, have been installed with the industry standard 3-3-3 abreast layout.

The selection of the interior hardware continues the flag carrier's existing OEM relationships. Rockwell Collins supplied the seats for all three cabins. Each seat features a Thales AVANT in-flight entertainment system. Internet connectivity is provided by SITA OnAir.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that MSN 39294 (registered A4O-SF) was delivered to Oman Air on 27 June, and is the second 787-9 the carrier has received from US lessor Air Lease.

The introduction of the new aircraft marks a big change to Oman Air's UK operations. As of 1 July, the airline has switched equipment on both of its UK routes, from the Airbus A330 to the 787 in each case. Two-class 787-8s serve Manchester, while larger 787-9s are operated to Heathrow.

FlightGlobal schedule data shows that Oman Air serves Heathrow twice daily. The three-class 787-9 is used for the flight departing Muscat in the afternoon and returning from Heathrow overnight, while the morning flight is operated with a 787-9 in a two-class configuration.

Previously, both of the airlines twice-daily Heathrow services were operated with three-class A330-300s. Acting chief executive Abdulaziz Al Raisi notes that Oman Air will reintroduce first-class service on the morning flight from the beginning of the 2018-9 winter season. ""In October, we are getting our second three-class 787-9, so London will be served with these two aircraft so both flights will have first class.""

A further two-class configuration 787-9 will also be delivered in late 2018, bringing Oman Air's total 787 fleet to 10 units.

To ensure consistency of service, Al Raisi says Oman Air will reconfigure three older A330s with the latest business-class seat installed on more recently delivered A330-300s.

In the longer term, the airline's 10 A330s will be replaced. ""We don't keep widebodies for more than 12 to 15 years, so we are finding a replacement for those [A330] aircraft,"" says Al Raisi. ""By 2022, Oman Air will have 20 widebody aircraft, and we are currently evaluating both the Boeing 787-9 and 787-10 and Airbus A350-900 and -1000."" In the same timeframe, by 2022, Oman Air intend to operate a fleet totalling 64 aircraft.

Al Raisi expects that the introduction of Muscat airport's new passenger terminal will enable the airline to grow. The new facility was opened on 20 March and will ultimately offer capacity for 20 million passengers per annum.

""We had a lot of difficulties with the old airport terminal,"" says Al Raisi. ""Now, it is very easy for transit passengers."" Visa application procedures for visitors to Oman have also been simplified, he adds.

""We will still work as a hub business with Muscat airport as a hub, but we are moving to a destination airline promoting Oman as a destination,"" says Al Raisi. ""Our whole airline represents Oman as a destination.""",Flight Global,0

"ATR foresees 20-year demand for just over 3,000 new turboprops, mainly from operators in emerging economies.

In its newly issued 2018-2037 market forecast, the European manufacturer predicts that the number of in-service 30-90-seat turboprops will grow to 4,060, from 2,260 today.

Some 1,220 within the current fleet will need replacement, while a further 1,800 will be required for growth, says the airframer, which is jointly owned by Airbus and Leonardo.

The vast majority of demand, nearly 80%, will be for aircraft with 60-80 seats – a segment addressed by the ATR 72 – while the balance represents a ""big opportunity"" for the ATR 42, vice-president of marketing Zuzana Hrnkova said at a briefing in London on 29 June.

Hrnkova sees potential demand for 630 aircraft with 40-60 seats, driven both by fleet replacement and by operators of legacy 30-seaters that upgauge to larger equipment. The ATR 42 is the only Western-built 50-seat turboprop still in production.

Asia-Pacific is the region with the greatest predicted demand, for 740 aircraft. However, that excludes China, where ATR foresees a requirement for an additional 300 aircraft, and South Asian countries, which will take 260.

In Latin America, ATR predicts demand for 420 aircraft. Africa and the Middle East, North America, and Western Europe each account for 350 deliveries, the forecast suggests, while a further 250 aircraft will be required in Central Europe and the CIS region.

In the 2010-2017 period, ATR took a 75% share of the market for Western-built turboprops against its sole rival, the Bombardier Q400; Hrnkova says the European manufacturer intends to maintain that dominance in the future.

She says a key driver of turboprop demand is an ability to establish new routes in areas that are not served, or are underserved, by air transport.

Some 58% of existing regional aviation routes – which ATR defines as being shorter than 900nm (1,670km) and being served with up to 450 seats a day – have been created since 2002, says Hrnkova, noting that the rate at which new routes have been opened has increased since 2012.

There is ""a lot of opportunity"" for the turboprops as they represent ""the most suitable connectivity tool"" for remote regions, she argues.

ATR predicts that ""around 30%"" of regional air traffic in 2037 will be generated by routes that do not exist today.

Meanwhile, air traffic in ATR's seat segment will grow 4.5% per annum, the manufacturer expects.",Flight Global,0

"Sukhoi's civil aircraft division is concentrating on developing a composite wing for the proposed 75-seat version of its Superjet 100.

Speaking to FlightGlobal, Sukhoi Civil Aircraft president Alexander Rubtsov said the airframer is developing wing profiles for the shrunk twinjet.

But he states that a composite wing is considered the ""main option"" for the aircraft.

S7 Airlines is contributing to technical requirement guidance, and has tentatively committed to taking up to 75 of the type.

""Requirements from customers are very high,"" says Rubtsov. He says the quantity of composite used in the new aircraft is likely to be ""significantly larger"".

""We're at the stage of placing orders with our technology partners,"" adds Rubtsov. It has issued requests for proposals for the landing-gear, avionics, auxiliary power unit and other systems.

""Some systems [are drawn] from existing ones, some are new,"" says Rubtsov, who states that Russian suppliers could account for 50% of the aircraft.

Analysis of new materials, including composites and alloys, is being undertaken by Russian research institute VIAM. The Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute is also set to conduct flight modelling studies.

Rubtsov indicates that a 3m test section will be manufactured for stress and fatigue tests to assess the feasibility of the composite wing structure.

""We're talking with a number of airlines [on the 75-seat version],"" he says. ""The performance looking to be promising.""

He states that United Aircraft and Sukhoi Civil Aircraft are aiming for a ""unified"" platform with the Irkut MC-21, such that both look ""exactly the same"" from the pilot's point of view – enabling easier conversion training – while the cabin interiors would feature the same design approach and level of comfort.

Bringing the two types together, he adds, will also lead to greater efficiency in sales and after-market support.

Sukhoi Civil Aircraft's newly-published annual report refers to a strategy of developing a 76- to 88-seat aircraft with a new wing but retaining the PowerJet SaM146 engine.

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - AirAsia X Bhd (AIRA.KL) needs to ensure the price, performance, engines and payment terms for the Airbus (AIR.PA) A330neo are right before it will “finally confirm” its order for 66 of the jets, its co-group chief executive said on Tuesday.

AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia Group Bhd (AIRA.KL), is the largest customer for the A330neo, which is struggling for sales relative to the rival Boeing 787 (BA.N).

AirAsia X has a firm order for the fuel-efficient A330neo widebody jets to replace its older first-generation A330s but it has been pushing back the delivery dates.

It has been talking to Boeing about buying the 787-10 jet as an alternative and is likely to make a decision later this year, a person familiar with the discussions previously told Reuters.

The airline’s co-group CEO, Tony Fernandes, said on Twitter on Tuesday that he was visiting Airbus at its Toulouse headquarters to discuss the A330neo and the smaller A321neo.

“We have ordered the 330 but to finally confirm it we must make sure price is right. Performance is right. Engine is right. PDP (pre-delivery payments) is right.” he said. “And performance of the 330 251-tonne is right. If right, (it is) the plane we dreamt of and fought for and then we can order more. Or else.”

Pre-delivery payments are made to manufacturers in the run-up to production and are sometimes financed using loans. It remains unclear to what extent AirAsia has yet paid advances.

The remark is the latest in a series of teasing comments from Fernandes apparently designed to heighten competition between Boeing and Airbus and to take advantage of AirAsia’s position as an anchor customer for the A330neo.

After a series of losses to Boeing’s 787, several analysts have said the future of the A330neo will be under mounting scrutiny if AirAsia abandons its order.

However, with this month’s Farnborough Airshow approaching, Airbus is expected to do its utmost to try to bag at least one alternative order to restore some momentum to the program.

With only 214 A330neos on order - including 66 for AirAsia X and another 28 for IranAir that are unlikely to be delivered due to U.S. sanctions - the program is in need of a fresh boost to mop up more than 15 unsold production slots next year.

The 251-tonne version, which could fly non-stop from Kuala Lumpur to London, is designed to provide more range by improving fuel capacity but will not be available for delivery until 2020.

Fernandes also said on Tuesday he believed the A321neo, a large narrowbody jet, was a “great plane” and raised the prospect of ordering more. He is also the CEO of AirAsia, which has 100 A321neos on order.",Reuters,0

FlightGlobal Schedules shows that ANA plans to operate 316 domestic services with 787-8s and -9s during the period, meaning that the engine checks will cancel over one third of ANA’s 787 domestic flights.

Against ANA’s total of 3,241 domestic services, however, the 787 cancellations are negligible.

“Over the last two years, we have been working very closely with Rolls Royce and the regulatory authorities,” says ANA.

“However, due to the additional mandatory inspections that were announced by the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau on [14 June], which involve twice as many engines to be inspected, we are cancelling a limited number of flights.”

Sales grew by 16 % year on year to €1.53 billion ($1.78 billion) in 2017. The manufacturer says the increase was ""strongly influenced"" by the production ramp-up on the Airbus A350.

Diehl notes that demand for the A380 – for which the company supplies several packages – ""has fallen short of expectations for several years"". But the supplier insists that equipment deliveries for the A350 and single-aisle programmes have ""compensated"" for the shortfall on the superjumbo.

Despite a large order backlog, Diehl says that ""the market in other segments is currently cooling down"".

Aside from Boeing's potential New Mid-market Airplane ""no new civil aviation programmes will be launched in the near future"", Diehl says.

As new business prospects with airframers will be ""very restricted in the years to come"", Diehl sees particular importance in directly supplying airlines with interior equipment for retrofit projects.

“I’m convinced we’ll see first results already in the next couple of weeks,” Enders told employees at a CSeries plane factory near Montreal.

Asked later about CSeries orders, Enders told reporters there might be something to see in time for the industry’s flagship event, the Farnborough Air Show, which begins on July 16.

He did not elaborate on whether this meant new firm orders for the 110- to 130-seat planes.

Airbus SE (AIR.PA) took a majority stake in Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) CSeries after completing a tie-up with the Canadian train and plane maker on Sunday.

Bombardier agreed in 2017 to sell Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in its key commercial jet for a token fee of one Canadian dollar, after sluggish sales, high costs and low production rates pushed the plane programme well over budget.

Enders repeated comments from 2017 that he expects to sell “thousands” of CSeries aircraft, although neither he nor plane programme head Philippe Balducchi would give specific figures for new orders in 2018.

Balducchi told employees the European planemaker would have to “drastically cut costs,” reiterating the company’s plan to bring down the cost structure of CSeries production.

While Airbus is expected to put pressure on CSeries suppliers to lower costs, Enders did not give specifics on whether there could be employee cutbacks.

“We’re at the start of this partnership,” he said.

Enders also told reporters he is worried that an escalation in a U.S. trade dispute with other countries could trigger retaliation that could impact air traffic.

“Of course we’re worried if this escalates,” Enders said.

He foresees ""a virtuous cycle for the Brazilian aerospace industry, increasing its sales potential, production, creating jobs and income, investments and exports, and in doing so, adding more value to customers, shareholders and employees"".

Boeing says the transaction values Embraer's commercial aircraft operations at $4.75 billion. Hence, Boeing's 80% stake is worth $3.8 billion.

The US airframer expects the proposed partnership to be accretive to its earnings per share from 2020 and produce annual pre-tax cost synergies of $150 million by year three.

""The partnership is a natural evolution of a long-standing history of collaboration between Boeing and Embraer over more than 20 years,"" adds Boeing.

On its finalisation, the commercial aviation joint venture will be led by Brazil-based management, including a president and chief executive. Boeing will have operational and management control of the new company, which will report directly to Muilenburg.

""The joint venture will become one of Boeing's centres of excellence for end-to-end design, manufacturing, and support of commercial passenger aircraft, and will be fully integrated into Boeing's broader production and supply chain,"" says the US airframer, which asserts that the joint venture will ""offer a comprehensive, highly complementary commercial airplane portfolio that ranges from 70 seats to more than 450 seats and freighters"".

Additionally, Boeing and Embraer are to create another defence-focused joint venture. ""Joint investments in the global marketing of the KC-390, as well as a series of specific agreements in the fields of engineering, research and development and the supply chain, will enhance mutual benefits and further enhance the competitiveness of Boeing and Embraer,"" states Nelson Salgado, Embraer's executive vice-president of financial and investor relations.

Boeing says financial and operational details of the strategic partnership are to be finalised, and definitive transaction agreements negotiated, ""in the coming months"". The release provides no details about several critical issues that reportedly delayed an agreement for months, including the accounting for Embraer's aftermarket sales and pool of engineers. The release also excludes any mention of Embraer Executive Jets, which appears to be omitted from the commercial partnership.

The transaction will then be subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, including approval from the government of Brazil. If these approvals are received ""in a timely manner"", Boeing expects the transaction to close by the end of 2019.",Flight Global,0

The airframer revealed the agreements in its first-half order backlog figures. It states that the A350s have been ordered by a new customer for the type.

Its long-haul business benefited from the formal recording of an order for 25 A350-900s from Turkish Airlines during June.

"Embraer expects to secure approval for its proposed commercial aviation joint venture with Boeing within the current administration of Brazil president Michel Temer, before a new government takes over in 2019 following elections in October.

Embraer needs to reach a definitive agreement with Boeing for the joint venture, and plans to present it for approval by the Brazilian government around end-October or early November at ""the latest"", says Embraer chief executive Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva in a call with investors.

Under the proposed joint venture, neither Boeing and Embraer will be able to sell their stakes in the joint venture for a period of 10 years from the close of the deal. Boeing will pay $3.8 billion for a 80% stake in the joint venture, with Embraer holding the remaining 20%.

The Brazil government, which holds a golden share in Embraer, has the right to block the proposed joint venture. Approvals by Embraer's shareholders are expected around early to mid-December following government approvals, adds Silva.

The transaction also requires approvals by anti-trust regulators in at least 10 jurisdictions, including Europe and China, say Embraer executives.

The Brazilian manufacturer says it does not expect any major regulatory hurdles, as it points to the eight months it took for Airbus and Bombardier to gain approvals for Airbus taking a majority stake in the CSeries programme. Boeing and Embraer expect to close their proposed joint venture by end-2019.

The planned joint venture will assume all of Embraer's debt related to its commercial aviation segment. While Embraer says this constitutes a ""good amount"" of the company's overall debt, its executives were not able to specify an exact figure.

"PARIS (Reuters) - An Airbus A380 jet returned by Singapore Airlines has found a home with Portuguese leasing firm HiFly, marking a respite for Europe’s slow-selling superjumbo after the first two second-hand aircraft looked set to be broken up for parts.

HiFly and the plane’s owner Doric Aviation formalised the deal in time for this month’s Farnborough Airshow, where Airbus and investors in the world’s largest airliner will be striving to demonstrate that it has a future, industry sources said.

Doric was not immediately available for comment.

Airbus and HiFly announced that the leasing firm had received an A380 but did not say where it had originated.

The deal comes weeks after German investment company Dr Peters said it would strip two A380s for parts after failing to find an airline willing to keep them flying.

It has said the same fate may await two more A380s, though industry sources say it is trying to negotiate a deal with an Asian airline to spare those jets from the scrapyard too.

Together with the plane remarketed by Doric Aviation, these represent the first five aircraft deployed by Singapore Airlines, which gave the double-decker its debut in 2007.

Singapore Airlines opted not to renew the 10-year lease on those aircraft, though it has also ordered some new planes.

Stimulating a second-hand market for the A380 is widely seen as vital to prop up ailing new sales of the aircraft, which seats 544 passengers and costs $445 million (£337 million) at list prices.

Many airlines are nervous about investing in such large jets because of the challenges of keeping them full all year round, especially at a time when rising oil prices are inflating costs.

The earliest A380s to enter service were overweight and beset with problems over wiring during assembly so it is especially difficult to adapt them for new buyers - a process which can cost $40 million for such a big jet, sources said.

HiFly is therefore expected to operate the aircraft without major cabin changes. The company specialises in renting out planes with crews, a practice known as “wet-leasing”.",Reuters,0
"Airbus is pitching the combination package of its A321LR and A330neo at the middle-of-the-market sector as Boeing continues to explore its proposed NMA.

The European airframer has increased the range of its A321neo, which is aimed at the Boeing 757-200 replacement market, and is awaiting certification of the A330neo.

Airbus has drawn up new categories for its global market forecast, based on seat-count and range, to account for aircraft performance evolution and consequent changes in airline strategy and business model.

Chief commercial officer Eric Schulz says the A330neo and A321neo – both of which fit into its ‘medium’ category of jets up to 300 seats – give airlines the chance to experiment with long-range routes and the option to move up to higher capacity.

He insists that introducing a new product into this line-up “doesn’t make sense”.

"Airbus has started bringing down the backlog of parked engineless A320neo-family jets, after the total reached triple figures at the end of May.

Commercial aircraft president Guillaume Faury, speaking at a briefing in London, admitted that engine problems had resulted in ""slightly more"" than 100 aircraft being parked, awaiting powerplant installation, after assembly.

Airbus had temporarily suspended deliveries of Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered A320neos earlier this year, and has also faced disruption to delivery of those powered by CFM International Leap-1A engines.

Faury says that the backlog figure is ""now getting down"" from the triple-figure peak, declining to 86 by the end of June.

The airframer delivered 110 A320neo and A321neo jets over the first half of this year, and Faury points out that, in May and June, it delivered more A320neo-family than A320-family aircraft.

"Airbus commercial aircraft president Guillaume Faury insists the airframer is ""not bluffing"" in its warnings over the uncertainty surrounding the UK's future trade relationship with the European Union.

Faury pointed out, during a briefing in London, that achieving a three-month protection buffer for aircraft production – given that the UK's EU withdrawal date is nine months away – will require suppliers to increase parts output by a third.

""[But] most suppliers are already at maximum production, because of the ramp-up,"" he says.

Faury states that Airbus has to prepare for a possible UK exit from the EU without a suitable trade agreement – potentially resulting in a production halt.

He points out that, without an agreement over certification, the airframer will not be allowed to install parts. The airframer is looking at alternatives to UK suppliers but Faury admits that they are not easy to find, especially given the criteria of competency and capacity.

""We're not bluffing,"" he says. ""You bluff when there's a benefit to bluffing.""

Airbus chief executive Tom Enders tells FlightGlobal that the company is not intending to initiate any sudden and drastic pull-out from the UK. ""We're not going to pack everything up,"" he says, stressing that the immediate considerations would centre on future investment.

But he also says that maintaining UK production over the longer term is a ""different story"", and that – if it proves necessary – eventual transfer of wing production out of the UK is ""possible and doable"".

Enders says that he believes the UK needs to stay in the European customs union, and remain a member of key regulatory organisations – including both the European Aviation Safety Agency and the European Court of Justice – in order to ""minimise damage"" to business.

Without EASA certification, or an equivalent, in place, the supply chain could ""fall apart"", he says. Enders describes this possibility as ""very troubling"" and, while it amounts to a ""worst-case scenario"", he states: ""It's not a scenario we can exclude.""

R-R chief executive Warren East states that the sale will ""enable us to focus on our three core businesses"" – aerospace, defence and power systems.

The commercial marine division employs around 3,600 staff members – the majority of whom are located in the Nordic region. It generated a £70 million operating loss on revenue worth £817 million in 2017, R-R says.

"Consolidation and integration of airliner production, on both a corporate and industrial basis, is a complicated business for an industry that tends to stress the importance of family.

The company's arc covers the Sukhoi Superjet and Irkut MC-21, the CRAIC CR929 venture with China, the revived Ilyushin Il-114, plus the Tupolev Tu-204 – a mix of jets and turboprops, new designs and old.

Its pick'n'mix of civil aircraft flavours and markets is a consequence of the historical development of air transport through the Soviet era, but it contrasts with the single-brand, single-family impression presented by Airbus and Boeing – an impression both will be intent on preserving as they embark on the assimilation of external types into their line-up.

Sukhoi and Irkut have adopted separate family ­concepts for the Superjet and MC-21, but a stated ­objective of bringing the two aircraft closer together will be tough to achieve at a technical level.

"Engine companies bidding for Boeing’s potential New Mid-sized Airplane (NMA) could face a new safety requirement proposed by regulators in response to a 2009 bird strike incident that caused an Airbus A320 to make an emergency landing in the Hudson River.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed the new certification test in a notice published on 6 July. It follows a similar rule making proposed by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last year.

Both agencies launched the lengthy rulemaking process based on a recommendation by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which had investigated the 15 January 2009 bird strike incident on US Airways Flight 1549.

Both of the A320’s engines ingested multiple Canada geese at about 2,800ft and 230kt during a climb-out from New York LaGuardia Airport. Despite losing nearly all engine thrust due to damage caused by the birds entering the engine core, pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger successfully landed the A320 in the Hudson River. All 150 passengers and crew aboard survived.

Although Sullenberger’s landing was successful, the near-disaster shook the confidence of regulators. Certification rules now require a bird ingestion test, but only during a full power take-off with the fan blades rotating at maximum speed.

Such a rule covers the risky scenario of an engine shutdown on takeoff caused by a bird ingestion, but does nothing to guarantee the safety of an engine during climb-out and descent. Pilots usually pull back the throttles shortly after taking off and run the engines back to idle on descent, so the fan blades are rotating more slowly than at full power. As the fan blades slow down, the concern is that larger pieces of the bird could enter the core of the engine.

So both regulators are proposing to amend the certification test requirements. Engine designs that have already applied for or received a certification, including the GE Aviation GE9X, would be grandfathered under the old rule. But new engine designs that apply for a type certification with the FAA or EASA could be subject to the proposed amended standard.

The FAA’s criteria matches the EASA’s proposed rulemaking from last year.

The new standard would require an ingestion test that simulates a medium-sized bird entering an engine core at 250kt at an altitude of 3,000ft, the FAA document dated 6 July states. The engine must be able to produce at least 50% of maximum rated thrust for up to 1min after the ingestion.

EASA and FAA have also proposed another test, but only if engine makers determine by analysis or test result that no part of the bird would enter the core at 250kt. The second test would require an engine to ingest a bird at 200kt at a simulated altitude of 3,000ft, with the fan rotating at the slowest possible speed.

The FAA will accept comments about the proposed rulemaking until 4 September. The comment period for the EASA rule closed last fall, but a final rule has not yet been publsihed.",Flight Global,0

"Embraer is that rare inspirational success story for a new entrant in the global aviation market. It was created by the Brazilian air force in 1969, nearly collapsed under state ownership, survived a painful transition to the private sector, and then conquered the regional-jet segment with the E-Jet family in the mid-2000s.

Along the way, this rare example of a globally ­competitive Brazilian manufacturer also transformed business aviation and took on Lockheed Martin's iron-fisted grip of the segment for tactical military transports.

The foundation of the company's success is its $3.37 billion commercial aviation business, now set to transform into a joint venture in which Boeing will take an 80% stake, after the two companies agreed the general terms of a deal. Embraer's Executive Jets and Defense & Security businesses will remain firmly under Brazilian control.

If the deal is finalised within 18 months, some may lament the loss of Embraer as an independent supplier of regional jets. But they would be wrong to do so.

In many ways, Boeing's proposed acquisition of a controlling stake in Embraer's hard-won commercial business is the best thing that has ever happened to the pride of Brazil's manufacturing industry.

The market has changed in the two decades since Embraer introduced the 50-seat ERJ-145. Consolidation has led to the rise of super-suppliers constructed to maximise leverage against Airbus and Boeing. Bombardier and Embraer both faced the prospect of negotiating with suppliers five to 10 times larger than themselves, to feed a regional and small narrowbody market that is tiny in comparison with the narrowbody operations at the big two.

Last September, Bombardier called it quits on the CSeries programme. Three months later, Embraer entered into negotiations with Boeing.

The difference between those two deals is striking. Forced to negotiate from a position of weakness, Bombardier gave away a majority stake in its flagship CSeries to Airbus after a decade of investment.

By contrast, Boeing has proposed to pay Embraer $4.75 billion for an 80% stake in the commercial aircraft division. In addition, Embraer becomes a leading candidate for engineering and structural work on existing and new programmes. It also gains access to Boeing's robust sales, marketing and services network. And the deal keeps Embraer intact to continue competing in the business aviation and defence markets. A successful outcome, it seems.",Flight Global,0
"When Airbus first set out back in 2004 to develop a new widebody under the A350 designation, it originally posited an upgraded version of the existing A330 twinjet.

"Airbus is predicting demand for almost 37,400 new passenger and freighter aircraft over the next 20 years.

This total is around 2,500 more than the figure the airframer gave in last year's outlook.

Airbus has revised the prediction in its latest global market forecast, covering the two decades to 2037.

It says that 26,540 aircraft will be needed for fleet expansion while the remaining 10,850 will be used to replace older types.

About 10,600 of the current fleet will still be in service in 2037.

Airbus says that the demand will double the global fleet to some 48,000 aircraft and result in a need to source 540,000 new pilots.

It has established a new categorisation system for its forecast, splitting the demand into four sectors – small, medium, large and extra-large, respectively covering up to 230, up to 300, up to 350 and over 350 seats.

The small category will continue to dominate with demand for 28,550 aircraft, valued at $3.2 trillion. Its highest category – into which the A350-1000 and A380 are placed – will need 1,590 aircraft worth $600 billion.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has failed to break an impasse with AirAsia over the fate of a multi-billion-dollar order seen as key to the future of its A330neo passenger jet, people familiar with the matter said.

FILE PHOTO: Tony Fernandes, CEO of AirAsia, holds a media event in Bangkok, Thailand May 15, 2018. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/File Photo

AirAsia (AIRA.KL) co-founder Tony Fernandes visited the planemaker this week for talks aimed at shoring up and increasing the existing order for 66 jets, but left Toulouse without signing a deal after what one source described as challenging talks.

The future of the deal with the airline’s AirAsia X (AIRX.KL) long-haul unit is crucial to the latest version of the A330, a key source of profits at the European group, after a string of market losses to Boeing’s (BA.N) competing 787 Dreamliner.

AirAsia declined to comment.

An Airbus spokesman said, “As a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in talks with our customers about their fleet needs. We keep the content of those talks confidential.”

Fernandes - who has spoken in the past of switching to the 787 only to reaffirm support for the A330neo and then raise fresh questions over the Airbus deal - publicly set out a list of conditions for confirming the planes this week.

These included price, performance, engines and advance payments, he said on his Twitter account, before adding: “Or else” in a remark apparently designed to leave open the prospect of reviving interest in the Boeing jet.

After meeting Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders, Fernandes wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday that the A330neo was a “great aircraft” for long-haul, low-cost travel, while adding: “Airbus has to work hard to make it a world beater. Let’s see”.

Fernandes, a music executive turned airline mogul, is adroit at keeping suppliers on their toes through his wide social media following. But the suspense over the deal is seen as a crucial test for Airbus as it tries to close a gap in orders this year compared to Boeing and defend the profitable A330 wide-body jet.

Sources say relations between Airbus and its largest Asian customer, which has ordered almost 600 single-aisle jets, have deteriorated following management changes at the planemaker and due to differences over prices and advance payment schedules.AirAsia X also has 10 A350s on order but in April, Fernandes said they were “too expensive” and would not be purchased. It is possible those orders could be converted to other jets, such as A330neos.

Airbus nonetheless hopes to strike an expanded final deal in time for the Farnborough Airshow in 10 days.

Airbus is working to secure at least one other significant A330neo order soon, industry sources said. It also posted an order for 10 A330neos from an undisclosed customer.

Aircraft demand has been driven mainly by strong economic growth in emerging markets and the need to replace older planes in mature Western markets.

Airbus also confirmed that it was studying further development of the largest member of the A320 family. Reuters reported last month that it was considering an A320 plane with a greater range to head off a potential Boeing mid-market rival.

The European planemaker said it was raising its 20-year forecast for total aircraft deliveries by more than 7 percent to 37,400 jets, worth $5.8 trillion at list prices.

That compares with 34,900 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion a year ago, partly as the result of a higher starting point as the industry absorbs another year of brisk growth in air travel.

Dominating the outlook is the market for ‘Small’ jets up to 230 seats, where Airbus has expanded its portfolio by closing a deal to buy Bombardier’s (BBDb.TO) 110-130-seat CSeries jet - mirrored on Thursday by a tentative deal by rival Boeing (BA.N) to acquire the commercial unit of Brazil’s Embraer.

These will represent 28,550 deliveries worth $3.2 trillion, or 76 percent of all units delivered over the next 20 years, Airbus said in an annual forecast.

Airbus has been hit by delivery delays of single-aisle planes due to engine shortages, but the company’s planemaking chief said it was over the worst, with a logjam of 100 undelivered jets dipping to 86 by end-June.

It is looking at increasing already record production plans for the jets to 70 a month from a 2019 goal of 60 due to strong demand, but has not made any decision, Guillaume Faury added.

STATISTICAL BATTLE

Its new forecasts redrew the traditional distinction between single-aisle or narrowbody jets and twin-aisle aircraft, and between the various types of long-distance aircraft.

The changes are particularly evident for the largest planes. Instead of singling out jets with 450 or more seats, which effectively means the four-engined Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, Airbus now places all planes with 350 or more seats - including the biggest twinjets - in one box called ‘Extra Large’.

It believes 1,590 of these will be delivered over two decades. Other categories include ‘Medium’ between 230 and 300 seats and ‘Large’ between 300 and 350 seats.

Airbus has been fighting a statistical battle for years with Boeing over demand for very large jumbos like the 747 and A380, where it has been more bullish than its U.S. rival.

Boeing says large twinjets like its 777X will soak up most of this demand and has abandoned forecasting the largest models.

The new Airbus framework ignores the number of engines and focuses on bands of seating, reflecting a view that the same market can be served in different ways, Chief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz said.

Airbus said the new methodology is based on the way airlines use their planes rather than the type flown, spurred in some cases by shifting business models. But the move is unlikely to temper debate over the future of the slow-selling A380.

Boeing, which is due to update its 20-year forecast this month, last year predicted total deliveries of 41,030 jets worth $6.1 trillion. Both firms say most new deliveries will permit growth in airline fleets rather than simply replacing old jets.

Speaking a week ahead of the Farnborough Airshow, Airbus officials hinted at sales of the A330neo, which has been hard to shift in the face of competition from the Boeing 787 recently, and of the soon-to-be-renamed Bombardier CSeries.",Reuters,0

"Sukhoi’s winglet-fitted Superjet 100 test aircraft has sustained damage during a landing incident in Moscow.

The aircraft – registered 97006 – had been conducting a sortie from Zhukovsky airfield’s Gromov flight-test institute, in order to assess aerodynamic performance.

As the twinjet prepared to land, following the test’s conclusion, the crew discovered that the right-hand main landing-gear had not fully deployed.

The crew opted to burn fuel and the Superjet subsequently landed, although Sukhoi’s civil aircraft division has not detailed whether the partially-deployed gear collapsed and, if so, whether the starboard engine contacted the runway.

It simply states that the jet “safely” landed and none of the three crew members – a test pilot, engineer and certification specialist – was injured. The test pilot had logged over 3,000h on Superjets.

On 4 July, the carrier said it would cancel 113 domestic 787 services between 6-12 July. On 9 July, it said that it would cancel an additional 176 domestic 787 services up to 22 July.

The latest round of cancellations brings the total number of cancellations to 619 between 6 July and 31 July. FlightGlobal Schedules shows that the carrier had intended to operate 1,346 domestic 787 flights during this period.

“Over the last two years, we have been working very closely with Rolls Royce and the regulatory authorities,” it says. “However, due to the additional mandatory inspections that were announced by the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) on June 14, 2018, which involve twice as many engines to be inspected, we are cancelling a limited number of flights.”

"Lufthansa Technik will use dry ice, rather than water, for on-wing engine-washing procedures from 2019.

The German MRO provider has developed the process over several years and filed a number of patent applications for it.

LHT says the use of dry ice – solidified carbon dioxide at -78.5°C (-109.3°F) – will reduce the time required to wash an engine to 30min, and enable the procedure to be conducted in sub-zero temperatures.

Previously, the MRO provider did not conduct its water-based ""Cyclean"" procedure in temperatures below 5°C because residual water could freeze in the engine core.

Under the new process, dry-ice pellets are shot into the core via a blasting system. They evaporate on impact with the engine's components, leaving no residue behind.

LHT says the impact of the ice-cold pellets – which measure a ""few millimetres in size"" – dislodges contamination from components in the engine's gas path.

The blasting system is installed on a mobile scissor lift and is suitable for ""all engine types, regardless of their size and height"", LHT says.

It adds: ""There is no need to fasten any pieces of equipment to the engine or to perform a run-up after the engine has been washed.""

Conventional engine-wash systems have water-spray devices, typically fixed to the air intake or to the fan's spinner.

LHT says the carbon dioxide used in the cleaning process is a byproduct of oil refineries and fertiliser production plants. ""No additional carbon dioxide has to be generated,"" it notes.

"An emergency descent by an Air China aircraft after cabin oxygen levels dropped has been linked to a co-pilot smoking an e-cigarette during the flight, state media said on Friday.

The state-backed Air China Boeing 737 aircraft was flying to the Chinese city of Dalian from Hong Kong when it went down to 10,000 feet (3,048 m), with oxygen masks deployed. Then it climbed again to continue to its destination, an incident that fuelled the concerns of safety experts.

Chinese airlines have a good safety record in general, but passengers have, on occasion, accused pilots of smoking during flights. Few such incidents have been confirmed, however.

""In the preliminary investigation, the co-pilot was found to be smoking an e-cigarette,"" state-owned China News said, citing a news conference by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) investigating Tuesday's incident.

""Smoke diffused into the passenger cabin and relevant air conditioning components were wrongly shut off, without notifying the captain, which resulted in insufficient oxygen,"" it quoted Qiao Yibin, an official of the regulator's aviation safety office, as saying.

China News added that the co-pilot had shut off the air conditioning units.

"LONDON (Reuters) - The Netherlands plans to sign an agreement to buy four unmanned Reaper drones next week, two people familiar with the talks said on Friday, confirming a deal that has been delayed due to budgetary constraints.

A Letter of Agreement for the surveillance drones could be signed next week at the Farnborough International Airshow outside London, the people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential.

The deal for the MQ-9 Reaper drones, made by California-based General Atomics, was first approved by the U.S. State Department back in 2015, when it had a value of $339 million (£256.2 million).

The air show is typically marked by a race for commercial plane orders between Boeing Co and Airbus, but this year U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing a “Buy American” initiative aiming at drumming up billions of dollars in arms sales for U.S. companies.

In April, the Trump administration rolled out a modification of its international arms sale policy making it easier to sell U.S. made weapons to allies.

Still, the people said that the sale of the four Reapers, associated equipment, parts and logistical support was not related to the new policy initiative.

The Dutch government said the intent to purchase was announced in 2016 as part of the Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle program. The deal was opposed by some Dutch lawmakers on July 5.

“We are going to purchase four Reapers. A letter was recently sent to parliament. The letter of agreement is the final hurdle,” Dutch Defence Ministry spokesman Peter Valstar said. He said the delay was not due to political opposition but budgetary reasons and that the order is now being fast-tracked.

A General Atomics spokesperson said the company values the relationship that it has with the Dutch air force “and look forward to continuing that relationship as the Netherlands joins other NATO MQ9 users to include the UK, US, France, Italy and Spain.”

Speaking after a NATO summit on Thursday, Trump said he was ready to help smaller NATO countries buy U.S. weapons as he pushed them to spend more on their own defence.

Trump claimed a personal victory at the summit after telling European allies to increase spending or lose Washington’s support.",Reuters,0
"CAE's move into the training services market has proved one of its smartest strategies since the company began, repairing aircraft radios, in 1947. The rapid growth of the airline industry – much of it in markets such as Asia where there was little pilot training infrastructure – has led to a surge in demand for newly qualified pilots and for type and recurrent training for existing flightcrews.

At the same time, military operators – faced with tighter budgets to support their own instructors and training centres – have increasingly looked to outsource the training of their pilots. The trends have seen the Montreal-based business become the largest independent provider of training services across both the commercial and defence markets.

CAE was one of the first companies to begin manufacturing aircraft simulators in the 1950s, when it was known as Canadian Aviation Electronics. By the turn of the century, it had become the world's biggest manufacturer of full-flight – a status it retains today with a claimed 70% share of the market, dwarfing its three major competitors.

However, around that time it began looking seriously at the training supply market. A flurry of investment in its own centres and acquisitions, including Schreiner Aviation Training in Amsterdam in 2001, business aviation specialist SimuFlite a year later, and, most notably, Oxford Aviation in 2012, saw it expand its footprint across the world.

Today, the provision of training services, as opposed to the manufacture and sale of training devices, makes up around three-fifths of CAE's $2.16 billion annual revenues, although the company does not break the two activities out in its results.

""It has been a very deliberate approach to broaden our business into services, as a natural extension of our heritage,"" says chief executive Marc Parent. ""Some 60% of our revenues are now related to training. That's a very big shift, because in the 2000s, services made up around 20%, and that was largely aftermarket.""

GROWTH AREAS

The company has almost become a victim of its success in manufacturing; with such a dominant share, and demand largely governed by aircraft delivery cycles, it is a ""slow growth market"", admits Parent. However, there is ""double-digit"" annual growth potential in training provision. ""All things being equal, yes, you will see us move more into services,"" he says.

Last year, CAE published its first pilot demand outlook, which predicted a need for 255,000 airline pilots over the next decade – the equivalent of 70 pilots a day – and 180,000 captains. In addition, the business aviation sector will require more than 50,000 pilots. ""The world is going to need a lot of airline pilots,"" says Parent. ""We are seeing a very hot market for flightcrews in the next decade.""

CAE has signed more than 40 long-term training agreements with airlines in the past 12 months. In some instances, it provides instruction at its own centres, or hours on its simulators. At the same time, it has set up a series of joint ventures with airlines, setting up dedicated training departments using CAE equipment and jointly funding them with carriers.

HEADING UPSTREAM

Since its acquisition of Oxford, a largely ab initio flight school, so-called pilot creation programmes have become increasingly important, with the company launching around 10 of these in the past two years as airlines have looked to become much more involved upstream in the supply of new pilots. Every year, CAE graduates more than 1,000 cadets, with around four-fifths of them sponsored by airline customers who guarantee them a job.

Customers include Air Asia, China Eastern, China Southern and Japan Airlines, with AeroMexico, American Airlines, JetBlue and Jetstar Airways coming on board in recent months. In some cases, CAE offers multi-crew pilot licence (MPL) training, designed to train candidates as first officers in a more realistic airline environment. Some 85 AirAsia cadets, for instance, have been through the MPL programme since 2010.

While CAE has been in the defence sector since being given the contract to design a simulator for an Avro Canada CF-100 in 1952, its penetration in the market increased significantly in 2001 when it acquired BAE Systems' Florida-based training division, which had contracts with the US military. It has since won major deals for the likes of the US Navy’s Sikorsky MH-60 and US Air Force's Lockheed Martin C-130J.

During the same decade it began an outsourcing contract to train UK helicopter pilots, and in Germany it won the deal to train pilots for the Eurofighter Typhoon and NH Industries NH90. By 2010, the military business had grown to around half of CAE's revenues. However, the ongoing growth of the commercial side, and falling military budgets has seen the proportion represented by defence fall back in recent years.

Recent deals have included, in 2015, the prime contract to supply NATO's Flying Training in Canada programme, and, the same year, a deal to train US Army fixed-wing pilots at a new centre in Alabama. In both instances, CAE owns the aircraft and the facilities.

Parent says in the defence market there is an ""increasing propensity for governments to outsource training"", adding: ""Militaries are rising to their own personnel challenges by having more conversations with us about what we can do."" The aim of many modern defence services, he says, is to ""focus on readying the warfighter for the mission and less on support roles"".

Despite the push into services, CAE has continued to innovate on the equipment side, launching its latest-generation commercial product, the 7000XR Series full-flight simulator in 2015, and following it earlier this year with the 600XR flight-training device (FTD). At this year's show, the company will launch the 700MR FTD, designed for military helicopter flight and mission training.

The past few years have seen Airbus and Boeing announce their intention to capture more of what they see as a lucrative market in services. Their strategy is to make further inroads into the parts aftermarket – an area they had previously been content to leave largely to their suppliers – and also training, if not in the manufacture of flight simulators, then the provision of training to their airline customers.

Parent, however, insists competition with the OEMs ""is not really new"". He adds: ""The OEMs have always been interested in the aftermarket, but we are the only pure play in the business. We focus on the end-customer and being the best at what we do. [The airframers] will play their game and we will play ours, and, where appropriate, we will partner with them and get win-wins.""",Flight Global,0
"Was Airbus taking majority ownership of the CSeries on 1 July good or bad for Canada’s aerospace sector? It depends if your pint glass is half full. The upbeat take on the deal is that the European manufacturer will secure the future of a clean-sheet programme that, while brimming with innovative technology, has struggled for orders in the 10 years since its launch – and safeguard tens of thousands of Canadian jobs.

Those of a half-empty persuasion will suggest Bombardier, and the Ottawa government, have been humiliatingly forced to sell the farm at a knockdown price after a failed attempt to break into the Airbus/Boeing duopoly.

There seems little doubt that the decision to set up the CSeries partnership – handing Airbus a free majority stake with no debt obligation – was the only way to save the Pratt & Whitney PW1500G-powered CS100 and CS300. The Quebec government had already bailed out the programme and deliveries this year had slowed to a trickle as Boeing lawyers challenged an order from Delta Air Lines in the US courts. Duopolies do not take kindly to interlopers and the chances of Bombardier struggling on alone were close to zero.

So where does the Airbus deal leave the country’s aerospace industry? While the Beaudoin family and Bombardier's other shareholders have been left with a 31% stake in the CSeries, that is better than 100% of potentially nothing. They also still control the rest of a still very much alive and kicking Bombardier. Aside from the rail transportation business, it now comprises the rump of the commercial aircraft division – the CRJ regional jet family and Q400 turboprop – and a business aviation arm consisting of the Learjet, Challenger and Global brands. An aerostructures operation is based largely outside Canada.

BACK IN BUSINESS

The business aviation division appears to be thriving once again, thanks largely to the in-development Global 7500 ultra-long-range, large-cabin jet, a new version of the Global 7000 that was introduced at the EBACE event in Geneva in May. Bombardier, Gulfstream and Dassault are the only manufacturers competing at this end of the market. The Global 7500 features new Rolls-Royce Pearl engines and becomes the longest-range business jet in the world. It sits alongside two other Global variants and the smaller Challenger 650 and 350 family, as well as Wichita-based Learjet, a venerable brand in a struggling segment.

In a report published as the CSeries transaction was being finalised, the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada and Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development estimated that aerospace was worth C$25 billion ($19.1 billion) to the economy in 2017 and contributed 190,000 jobs. As well as Bombardier, Montreal-based CAE is the world leader in flight simulation and training, while Pratt & Whitney Canada, a subsidiary of US group United Technologies, is a powerhouse in engines for regional, business, and general aviation aircraft.

While the aerospace sector ranks as the fifth-largest in the world in terms of turnover – after the USA, the UK, France, and Germany – the AIAC says the government cannot be complacent. ""We are also seeing some decline in the industry,"" says AIAC president and chief executive Jim Quick. ""More work needs to be done to ensure that Canada remains a place which attracts and retains investment in this sector, which is so essential to innovation and the future of our economy.""

Pratt & Whitney Canada, based in Longueuil, near Montreal, secured its latest customer for its range of business jet engines earlier this year when Dassault announced that a version of its PW800 turbofan would power its latest Falcon 6X, after the French manufacturer abandoned plans for a similarly sized 5X with Safran Silvercrest engines. It was the second major deal for P&WC in the sector, after the PW800 – which shares technology with Pratt & Whitney's PW1000 geared turbofan – was chosen to provide the engines for Gulfstream's soon-to-enter-service G500 and G600 in 2014.

P&WC has been an autonomous unit of the Connecticut-based propulsion giant, and part of Canada's aerospace heritage since before the Second World War and has more than 13,000 customers and some 63,000 engines in service. Many of these are the ubiquitous PT6 turboprop family, introduced in 1963, although turbofans such as the PW300, PW500 and PW600 are still strong sellers. The company – which also offers a range of auxiliary power units – employs 9,400 staff, almost 6,000 of them in Canada, including at a technical centre in Mirabel, Quebec.

TRAINING CENTRE

The Montreal area is also home to CAE, the world's largest manufacturer of flight training simulators for the airline, military and business jet markets, and now also the largest independent training provider in the industry. CAE has been one of Canada's star aviation performers in recent years as it has transformed from a largely manufacturing-led business into one that makes the majority of its revenues from the services sector.

Another notable Quebec player is Héroux -Devtek, which has evolved over the past decade from a supplier of landing gear components and landing gear for regional airliners to a strong number three in the mainliner market, alongside United Technologies and Safran. Its breakthrough contract came in 2013 when it won the contract to design and manufacture the main and forward landing gear for Boeing’s new 777X, as well as current 777 models, from United Technologies. To support the assembly of the component, Héroux-Devtek opened a factory in Cambridge, Ontario in 2015.

The company this month expanded its US footprint with the acquisition of Beaver Aerospace & Defense, a Michigan-based manufacturer of ball screws and actuation systems, largely for defence customers. It followed its agreement late last year to buy CESA, a Spanish Airbus subsidiary specialising in landing gear, actuation and hydraulic systems. In its latest full-year results statement in May, chief executive Gilles Labbé said the company was ""in a healthy financial position to pursue our next expansion phase"", and ""well positioned to obtain a number of contracts on several aircraft programmes"".

The other major aerospace player in the Montreal area is Bell. The Textron subsidiary has assembled 4,900 commercial rotorcraft in the country since establishing its Mirabel facility in 1986 – it also has a site in Calgary – and claims to support 8,800 Canadian jobs through direct employment and the supply chain. In 2016, the Montreal aerospace industry got a significant boost when Bell announced that it was transferring production of its 505 Jet Ranger to Mirabel.

While Montreal is Canada's largest aerospace cluster, employing some 40,000 across more than 180 firms, Ontario, and particularly the area around Toronto, runs it a close second. Bombardier is a major employer in the city and other notable employers in the province include Diamond Aircraft in London, business aviation maintenance and completions house Flying Colours in Peterborough, and modifications specialist Field Aviation in Mississauga.

One of them, Magellan Aerospace is a major supplier of aerostructures to Airbus and Boeing. In April, the company, which is traded on the Toronto stock exchange and has manufacturing facilities in the UK and the USA as well as Canada, secured a suite of contracts with Boeing, including for the manufacture of titanium wing fittings for the 787, and winglet components for the 737 Max. In April, Airbus awarded Magellan a five-year contract to supply A330 wing ribs.

Another Ontario-based company, MDS Aero Support, is to build a new gas turbine engine test facility for Rolls-Royce in Derby, featuring, it says, the largest indoor testbed of its type in the world. MDS worked with the National Research Council of Canada on the aero-acoustic features of the centre, which will be operational by 2020. The company, which has been in the market for more than 30 years, has also worked with Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, Siemens and MTU.

While the industry around Toronto and Montreal are the main centres of Canadian aerospace, there are also industrial clusters in the maritime, central and Western provinces of the country, with Calgary in Alberta being a particular stronghold. The Alberta presence at Farnborough this year features 11 of the roughly 50 aerospace companies based in the province. These include Viking Air, the company that resurrected the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter utility turboprop as the Series 400 and which has manufacturing facilities in Calgary and Victoria, British Columbia.

"L3 may be best known as a defence company, but the $9.7 billion-turnover US corporation is stepping up its focus on the civil market, bundling all its commercial businesses under a new brand.

The new L3 Commercial Aviation, unveiled on the eve of Farnborough, spans onboard avionics, airport security systems, and pilot training, and includes three companies acquired by L3 in the past six years – the full-flight commercial simulator division of Thales, based near London Gatwick airport, a training device manufacturer called Aerosim in Minneapolis, and the Southampton-based flight school and training provider CTC.

Although the three arms of the commercial business might appear to have little in common, Alan Crawford, president of L3’s commercial aviation solutions sector, says their coming together under one customer-facing organisation ""means we can have some very interesting conversations with airlines"" about their avionics requirements, pilot recruitment and training needs, and even ""the customer journey from kerbside to aircraft"".

Get all the coverage from the Farnborough air show on our dedicated event page

Rather than each entity having its own sales team, key account managers within L3 Commercial Aviation will be the main point of contact with airline and airport customers, bringing in experts from the individual businesses when necessary. ""That integrated approach is very unique in the market, but it's what our customers have been asking for, and you will see a lot more coming on that,"" says Crawford, who is based at L3 Commercial Aviation's headquarters in Crawley, near Gatwick.

YOUTHFUL AMBITION

L3 was formed just 21 years ago as a vehicle to acquire surplus businesses from Lockheed Martin – the L3 comes from the surnames of its two founders, former Lockheed executives Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta, together with their backer Lehman Brothers. A series of more than 25 acquisitions over the years has seen it grow to become one of the Pentagon's biggest contractors. It is organised across four divisions – electronic systems, aerospace systems, communication systems, and sensor systems.

Commercial Aviation falls within the electronic systems segment and covers three areas, each contributing roughly one-third of its revenues. The avionics business is made up of the ACSS transponders joint venture with Thales, in which the French company has a 30% stake, together with a business making flight-data recorders and cockpit displays. Airport security includes a number of enterprises acquired over the past 10 years producing the likes of baggage scanners and tracking technologies.

Finally, the training business includes simulator manufacturing, flight academies in Southampton, Bournemouth, Lisbon and New Zealand, and a new simulator training centre being built at Gatwick. Pilot training is one area where L3 has been extremely acquisitive in recent years. After buying the Thales manufacturing operation it has become the number two in full-flight devices after CAE.

The CTC takeover took it into the training services market for the first time – the business has contracts with a number of airlines for the ab initio training of cadet pilots. About 1,600 aspiring pilots begin courses there each year.

The new training centre on Crawley's Manor Royal industrial estate, which opens next year, represents a significant investment for L3. As well as training pilots on eight full-flight simulators, an adjacent manufacturing hall will assemble up to 30 devices a year for its own training business and third-party customers. The site will replace and expand on nearby facilities that L3 has leased on the large Thales campus since taking on the simulator business six years ago.

In May, ACSS won a contract with American Airlines to equip its Airbus A321 fleet with its SafeRoute automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast suite, as part of the carrier's compliance with upcoming Federal Aviation Administration NextGen air traffic management regulations. The package includes equipment to provide information on traffic, visual separation and interval management. ""That was a very big deal for us,"" says Crawford.

Another significant coup in commercial aviation was announced at the Paris air show in 2017, with Airbus entering a partnership with L3 and Leonardo's DRS arm to develop a deployable flight-data recorder, to be introduced on the A350 from next year and eventually across its entire range. A combined voice and data device, and mounted on the vertical fin, the unit is aimed mainly at transoceanic aircraft – Airbus's widebody family and the long-range A321LR. Instead of directly capturing information, the device will receive and store, in a memory module, a transmission of cockpit-voice and flight data.

Deployment of the recorder is triggered by significant structural deformation or impact with water. Because it does not need the same crash-protection structure as a regular flight data recorder, it can be relatively lightweight. If the aircraft comes down in water, sensors would detach it at a depth of 2m and the recorder would float, with an emergency locator transmitter helping emergency services locate the crash site. The technology was developed as a response to the crash of Air France flight 447 in the south Atlantic in 2009, when the flight recorders were not recovered from the sea bed for two years.

Although L3 is a group that has scaled up largely by acquisition, Crawford is keen to point out that ""huge organic investments"" – such as the deployable flight-data recorders – have also played a significant role in the company's growth, including in the commercial business, which represents about 30% of L3's revenues. At Farnborough, L3 will be ""trying to build awareness of the breadth of our commercial offerings"", he says, adding “rather than confusing customers with multiple brands, approaching them with a single brand”.

L3 has displayed a certain ruthlessness in the past when it comes to replacing or amending the trading identities of companies it acquires with the L3 branding, and it plans to continue this as it rolls out L3 Commercial Aviation.

Despite some initial scepticism, acceptance among teams is usually positive, maintains Crawford. ""We are creating something under L3 Commercial Aviation that's going to be something special in the market,"" he says. ""When you are acquiring for growth rather than cost synergies, that's always an exciting message to give new employees.""

"Ten years ago, GE Aviation and Safran sought to replicate the success of their CFM International joint venture when they agreed at the 2008 Farnborough air show to build a similar partnership for engine nacelles.

The two manufacturers established a 50:50 joint venture between GE's Middle River Aircraft Systems unit and Safran’s nacelle division – which separately manufacture thrust reversers and complete nacelles for a range of engines by different suppliers – and, in 2009, named the new business Nexcelle.

Get all the coverage from the Farnborough air show on our dedicated event page

While nacelles have traditionally been developed separately from engines, the purpose of the new venture is to produce ""integrated propulsion systems"" in close co-operation with the parents’ aero engine businesses, Nexcelle president Kenneth Onderko tells FlightGlobal.

Now, Nexcelle is nearing serial production for one of two nacelle programmes it has developed to date – for GE's Passport engine. That turbofan, the core of which has been derived from CFM’s Leap unit, powers Bombardier’s Global 7500 business jet, which is scheduled for certification later this year.

AMBITIOUS GOALS

Onderko says Bombardier had set out ""very aggressive"" weight, performance and noise targets. Achieving the aircraft’s 7,700nm (14,270km) range had, he says, ""a lot"" to do with an ability to ""truly optimise"" the overall structure of the engine and nacelle assembly and to avoid steps and gaps in the bypass stream's flow path. ""The requirements that Bombardier asked us to achieve were something that we had not been able to do on any programme before,"" he says.

The bypass stream flows through a single-piece composite barrel that envelops the engine core and which, Nexcelle says, includes ""advanced acoustic protection"" in order to reduce engine noise. Other features of the nacelle include a ""simplified"", weight-saving composite cowl, a fixed-nozzle thrust-reverser, and an anti-ice system that distributes hot air more efficiently around the inside of the air intake's leading edge. In order to reduce drag and noise, the leading edge skin is made from a single-piece aluminium sheet, rather than several pieces joined together.

A similar, single-piece inlet lip, albeit on a larger scale, has also been employed on Nexcelle’s second programme: the nacelle for CFM's Leap-1C, the initial powerplant for China's under-development Comac C919. The single-aisle aircraft will later be equipped with the alternative, locally produced CJ-1000 engine.

Nexcelle says the inlet lip surrounding the Leap-1C's 1.96m (77in) diameter fan is ""the largest of its kind to enter production on a large commercial jet engine"". Like its smaller sibling on the Passport powerplant, the Leap-1C air intake also has a ""directed-flow nozzle"" de-icing system, which, Nexcelle says, delivers ""weight, efficiency and maintainability improvements from traditional nacelle de-icing systems"".

NEW DESIGN

Arguably the most exceptional feature of the Leap-1C’s nacelle is its ""O-duct"" thrust-reverser mechanism. Rather than having two ""D-door""-style translating sleeves on conventional nacelles, the new configuration has a single-piece composite structure that slides aft when thrust reverse has been selected. Nexcelle says the electrically driven ""O-duct"" reduces drag in the airflow path and improves thrust-reverser efficiency.

Other features of the Leap-1C nacelle include an engine mounting system designed to reduce powerplant distortion and a fan cowl that is structurally integrated to the engine.

Onderko says nacelles have been delivered for a third C919 that is scheduled to start flight tests later this year. Entry into service of the C919 is scheduled for 2020-2021.

Integration of the Leap-1C and nacelle takes place in a facility that is jointly operated by CFM and Comac, located on the Chinese manufacturer's premises in Shanghai. Safran is the lead integrator for the Leap-1C nacelle, while GE has a leading role on the Passport nacelle programme.

Onderko believes the partnership between GE and Safran has enabled the two manufacturers to develop more advanced nacelles together than would be possible on their own. ""Each company has their expertise; there is some overlap, but in some places not,"" he says – adding: ""They do learn from each other and, I think, the two parent companies in the nacelle business are better today… than they were beforehand.""

He notes that while ""a lot of financial capital"" is required to develop nacelles for new engine programmes, the partnership allows both parents to ""bring the best of the best to the table"" and share risk, resources and returns.

So what are the next steps for Nexcelle? Onderko says GE and Safran are ""obviously"" looking for additional engines to be equipped with the joint venture's nacelles. He notes that new designs, such as the O-duct thrust-reverser can be applied to other platforms, but says there are no plans today to roll out that technology.

"When the first Farnborough air show took place in 1948, the UK was a very different place. Germany's defeat had left Britons buoyant but resigned to the fact that the cost of that conflict had plunged the country into deep depression.

However, the exploits of the Royal Air Force and an industry that had created formidable fighting machines from the Spitfire to the Lancaster bomber gave the government and aerospace chiefs faith that the UK could remain a pace-setter in a world that would soon enter an age of jet-powered long-haul travel, and require more advanced warplanes and technologies to counter a very different military threat.

Back then, the Farnborough air show was run by the Society of British Aircraft Constructors – a predecessor of ADS – and open only to UK exhibitors. There were enough of them – airframers and their nationally based supply chains – to create a showcase that attracted a huge international audience.

At a time of tight resources, the government played a key role in directing investment and research and development priorities, most obviously on the military side, but also in terms of commercial programmes. However, with the industries in France and Germany decimated by the war, the UK and the USA remained the world's dominant aircraft producers.

ALL CHANGE

The 70 years since have seen a whole lot of history: the Cold War, the revival of Germany and France, the space race, the European project, the fall of Communism, the rise of Asia. By the 21st century, the UK had gone from having half a dozen or more aircraft builders to just two – and none on the commercial side, if you do not count tiny Britten-Norman.

Aside from BAE Systems and engine-maker Rolls-Royce, much of the UK's major aerospace and defence footprint was by the early 2000s foreign owned or controlled, by the likes of Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, Safran and General Electric.

While some might bemoan the fact that the family silver has progressively been sold overseas, others welcome that formidable inward investment, ensuring the industry remains the world's second-largest by sales.

According to ADS, UK-based aerospace concerns turn over £35 billion ($46 billion) – with exports accounting for six-sevenths of that total – employ 123,000 directly, and have grown by almost 40% since 2012. From the plant in Broughton that produces every Airbus wing to hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises, the UK still punches well above its weight in aerospace relative to the size of its economy.

They would also argue that, while overseas shareholders – and even, in some cases, governments – may control the industry's purse strings, intellectual property remains firmly in the UK, either through regulations (in the case of some sensitive military technologies) or practice.

CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE

British engineers have specialised in designing wings for decades – with university research labs generating much of the IP – and that is why Airbus and Bombardier have invested hundreds of millions in centres of excellence in Bristol, Broughton and Belfast.

However, another B-word arguably threatens that state of affairs. In June, Airbus warned that a failure by the UK government to secure a friction-free deal with the EU post Brexit in 2019 could endanger its investments in the UK. Just before the Farnborough air show, ADS chief executive Paul Everitt said a ""worst case, no deal"" scenario – where there is no arrangement for goods and services to cross the English Channel without checks and possible tariffs – would be ""chaotic"" for UK industry.

Even a settlement that leaves the country as a more expensive place to do business could ""diminish our ability to attract investment"", he says, although the impact might not be felt overnight. ""Aerospace and defence are long-term businesses. When a big decision comes along – a new aircraft or some other major investment – we will not be so well placed. These are high-value activities that we treasure as a country that are likely to go somewhere else,"" he adds.

That said, while the Airbus UK production process is deeply entwined with the company's facilities in France, Germany and Spain, the industry is not solely dependent on trade with the EU. Boeing – which has very little direct industrial investment in the UK – buys components from dozens of British companies, spending £2.1 billion here in 2016.

Bombardier CSeries (now Airbus owned) composite wings are shipped from Belfast to Montreal. US implants owned by the likes of Raytheon and United Technologies produce systems, weapons and components for UK military aircraft that are also exported.

Major UK players such as BAE, aerostructures specialist GKN and aircraft systems supplier Meggitt also have sizeable investments overseas, including in the USA, where BAE is large enough to count as a prime contractor. Martin-Baker is one of a tiny handful of firms worldwide that make ejection seats for military aircraft. Rolls-Royce, one of the world's three big engine makers, makes most of its revenues on the commercial side from supporting a global fleet of installed engines.

Another area where ADS has concerns about the country's industrial future is the next-generation fighter. The UK is both an operator of the Lockheed Martin F-35 – in which BAE is a programme partner – and, through BAE, a shareholder in the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon. However, unlike France, where Dassault has retained its capabilities to design and build its own ""4.5""-generation fighter in the Rafale, it is unclear whether BAE would be able to go it alone with a successor to the Typhoon that would be required from the 2040s.

MAINTAINING INDEPENDENCE

The UK government – which under former Prime Minister David Cameron signed a defence co-operation pact with France in 2010 that could be endangered by Brexit – plans to unveil a combat air strategy. ADS says the strategy needs to provide the investment to retain an independent combat air capability in the UK, and deliver an aircraft that could be supported by exports. Necessary steps, suggests the trade body, include establishing a ""high-value"" design centre. The combat air sector currently contributes to the UK economy £8.3 billion in turnover and creates 31,000 jobs, says ADS.

With 29 country pavilions and 48 countries represented as exhibitors this year, the modern Farnborough air show is more of a global aerospace gathering than the shop window for the UK industry it was until 40 or 50 years ago.

However, throughout the halls and chalets, home-grown companies will be making their presence felt. There may never be another new all-British aircraft in the display, but most of the types represented at the show will have a significant contribution from the country's aerospace sector beneath the skin. Like the show itself, UK industry is more international than ever.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Aircraft engine maker CFM is confident it will meet a target to deliver 1,100 LEAP engines this year, despite still being a few weeks behind schedule, executives said on Saturday.

CFM, a joint venture between General Electric (GE.N) and Safran (SAF.PA), had said in May it was 4-6 weeks behind schedule.

On Saturday, CFM officials said the delay had peaked at about 7 weeks but had since eased to 4-5 weeks.

“The gap is closing” CFM executive vice president Sebastien Imbourg said in a briefing ahead of the Farnborough Airshow.

The delays have led to a queue of about a dozen semi-finished aircraft at Boeing’s Renton plant near Seattle parked without engines, industry sources said.

“We continue to work closely with our supply chain on their recovery efforts ... and we’re working closely with our customers to minimize any impact and ensure timely deliveries,” a Boeing spokesman said.

Airbus says it has more than 80 aircraft waiting for engines due in part to CFM delays, but mainly due to late supplies from alternative engine supplier Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N).

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - AirAsia (AIRA.KL) is discussing the possible purchase of another 100 Airbus A321neo jets as the company’s chief executive officer, Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, and Airbus go down to the wire in parallel negotiations for an expanded order for larger A330neo jets, industry sources said.

Fernandes may attend this week’s Farnborough Airshow where the two sides will attempt to end a rough patch in their relations and agree all or part of a complex package of wide-body and narrow-body jetliner orders, two sources said.

However, it remained unclear just how much fresh money the deal, if completed, would put in Airbus’ coffers as the low-cost carrier juggles existing orders and drives a tough bargain on prices and the size of deposits, one of the sources said.

Another said any deal could involve a significant number of conversions or “churn” between existing orders. AirAsia has ordered 600 jets, two thirds of which remain to be delivered.

Airbus declined comment. AirAsia could not be reached.

Two sources said AirAsia could place an order for up to 100 single-aisle A321neo jets worth $13 billion at list prices, as reported by Bloomberg News.

A third source suggested it could involve an upgrade from smaller models, which may trigger other orders. None of the sources, who are familiar with the matter, agreed to be quoted on confidential talks.

The range of options underscores the complexity of AirAsia’s portfolio as it expands. But despite the lure of a 100-plane order, all eyes are on whether AirAsia will confirm the A330neo, since there is no problem selling the smaller single-aisles.

AirAsia, Asia’s largest budget carrier, has been sending mixed signals for months about whether it will confirm its earlier deal for 66 of the upgraded A330neo - watched from afar by Boeing Co (BA.N), which hopes to replace the order with its 787 Dreamliner.

Delegates say Airbus needs a marketing lift for its A330neo and would relish bringing Fernandes to the widely publicised Farnborough Airshow to reconfirm and expand his order.

That’s because losing the A330neo’s biggest buyer could make bankers tighten their terms for financing the same plane for other airlines, and therefore hurt sales even more.

However, sources have said relations between the companies cooled following recent Airbus management changes.

An AirAsia order would signal that ties between Airbus and its biggest Asian customer have improved, though Airbus has signalled a drive to protect profit margins.

Financiers speculate AirAsia will push for discounts as high as 60 percent for the A321neo and two thirds for the A330neo. Standard industry discounts are closer to 50 percent.

Depending on negotiations, the amount of money handed over on day one alongside any new AirAsia order could be small.

Painted in an All Nippon Airways livery, FTA-3 (JA23MJ) took off from the MRJ flight centre in Moses Lake, in the US state of Washington, at 05:53 local time on 9 July and landed at Farnborough at 19:19 local time the day after, Mitsubishi tells FlightGlobal.

En route from Moses Lake to Farnborough, FTA-3 stopped at Bangor in the US state of Maine and at Keflavík airport, which serves Iceland's capital, Reykjavik.

In June 2017, the MRJ90 made its show debut at Paris, where FTA-3 appeared on static display after flying in from Moses Lake.

Mitsubishi is seeking to bring the MRJ90 into service with launch operator ANA in 2020.

"A former GE Aviation sales executive named Kevin McAllister scored the launch order for the Leap-1A engine at the Paris air show in 2011.

Seven years later, McAllister is the chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and the Leap-1 engine family is the second-most ordered jet engine in history, with its orderbook of more than 15,300 engines trailing only the 44-year-old CFM56 franchise.

As the GE/Safran Aircraft Engines joint venture enters the Farnborough air show, the only doubt about its ability to score more orders is the sheer size of the next-generation product's backlog. Orders for single-aisle aircraft now measure several times the annual production capacity of Airbus and Boeing combined. Despite the size of that backlog, CFM chief executive Gaël Méheust hints that Farnborough week could see yet another wave of new engine orders.

""Yes,"" he says. ""We will announce a few things at Farnborough.""

The current backlog of Leap engines is based on orders for installed and spare units for 7,140 aircraft, including 2,306 A320neo family aircraft with Leap-1As, 4,527 Boeing 737 Max aircraft powered by Leap-1Bs and 307 orders for the Leap-1C-driven Comac C919, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer.

Of the three Leap-1-powered aircraft, CFM competes for orders only on the A320neo. It is a familiar position for the Franco-US alliance. Since the late 1980s, the CFM56 has competed to power the original A320 family against the International Aero Engines V2500, winning a market share of roughly 60%. Airbus launched the A320neo family nearly eight years ago, collecting orders for 6,137 aircraft to date, the Analyzer data shows. Nearly two-thirds of those orders – amounting to 3,935 aircraft, or 7,870 engines excluding spares – have selected engine suppliers.

In a remarkable coincidence, the split of orders between the Leap-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G geared turbofan remains almost the same as that between the CFM56 and the V2500. Airlines and lessors have ordered 2,306 Leap-1A-powered A320neo family aircraft, accounting for 58.6% of all orders with engine selections to date, according to the Analyzer.

More importantly, to Méheust's point, slightly more than one-third of the A320neo family aircraft in the Airbus backlog do not have engines selected yet, providing a deep reserve of potential orders in future. The unannounced backlog includes dozens of aircraft ordered by existing Leap customers, including Frontier Airlines, Avianca and Qatar Airways.

There are orders for 4,500 Leap-powered Max aircraft

""One-third of [A320]neos haven't decided for an engine yet, so the potential for more engine campaigns is very important,"" Méheust says. ""But it's important for the Max, too. Other airlines are adding aircraft to their initial orders, so we don't see any form of slowdown in the rhythm of orders right now. It's kind of puzzling because we have been in that crazy mode since 2011 and we are in 2018.""

Indeed, CFM signed orders for more than 1,300 Leap engines in the first five months of this year, Méheust adds.

It did not always appear as though the Leap-1 engine would prove so successful in the market, though. On 13 July, CFM celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Leap-1 engine family, which occurred on the eve of the 2008 edition of the Farnborough air show. It was the same event that saw the launch of the then-Bombardier CSeries aircraft with a variant of the P&W geared turbofan engine family. Airbus and Boeing still seemed on the fence about re-engining the A320 and 737 families or starting over with clean-sheet aircraft designs and new engines.

In CFM’s launch announcement for the Leap engine, the joint venture also straddled the line between a full commitment and a careful hedge.

""We are excited about this new engine, but we also think we need to remain flexible,"" then CFM president Eric Bachelet said in 2008. ""If fuel prices continue to rise, we will need to raise the bar even higher and introduce even more advanced technology."" The new technology Bachelet had in mind was an open rotor engine.

INNOVATION

The other option available in 2008 was offered by P&W. By inserting a reduction gear between the low-pressure turbine and the inlet fan, P&W had designed an architecture that could expand the bypass ratio of a turbofan engine to 12:1, more than twice the ratio achieved on the CFM56. In a single stroke, it appeared to make a conventional turbofan architecture obsolete.

""In 2010, everybody was talking about this amazing engine with a gear that would change the face of the world. Time magazine made it their invention of the year in 2010,"" Méheust recalls.

Instead of following P&W's lead with a geared turbofan, CFM doubled down on the conventional architecture. By leveraging 3D-woven resin transfer-moulded fan blades invented by Safran and new high-temperature materials developed by GE, CFM put together a Leap turbofan engine design that initially met some scepticism from the market.

Méheust remembers CFM’s arrival at the 2011 Paris Air Show. The Leap engine family had been launched three years earlier, but was still waiting for a launch order. By the same date, P&W had won orders for more than 500 PW1100G-powered A320neo family aircraft. McAllister landed the launch order from Virgin America. Shortly afterward, Méheust, then the top sales executive for Safran, secured an order from SAS. It was just the beginning.

""By the end of that air show we had sold [engines for] 910 airplanes,"" a CFM spokeswoman says. ""That’s the point where we took the lead and never relinquished it.""

ONGOING NIGGLES

The Leap engine is not quite up to full speed yet. A barrier coating on a high-pressure turbine shroud suffers from a durability shortfall, requiring CFM to repair the coating on all engines delivered during the first year of production. Production yields by CFM's castings and forgings suppliers are too high, putting the Leap engine production months behind schedule until a planned catch-up by year-end.

The next decade will prove the ultimate winner in the engine competition, but the Leap now has a firm foundation.

""We knew that we were having the right response to the market,"" Méheust says. ""We knew we had the right architecture – the architecture that would provide the performance, but also the reliability.""

"European safety regulators have held discussions with Russian counterparts over several aspects of system certification for the Irkut MC-21.

The European Aviation Safety Agency talks took place in Cologne in the last week of June, says Russian federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia – which has taken over certification duties from the Interstate Aviation Committee.

Rosaviatsia says the discussions covered approaches to certification for areas including project management, air conditioning and pressure-control systems, cockpit security, minimum equipment lists, and other software and hardware.

It states that work is being undertaken with 18 working group panels following an agreement earlier this year on procedures to support EASA validation of the twinjet.

Rosaviatsia says a “significant amount” of research, bench- and flight-testing has been conducted since the original application for MC-21 certification was submitted in 2010. Efforts to pursue EASA approval were stepped up in 2016.

Irkut aims to secure certification initially for the Pratt & Whitney PW1400G-powered version of the aircraft, followed by the version equipped with Aviadvigatel PD-14 engines. Rosaviatsia says it held several meetings with the MC-21 and PD-14 developers during April-June this year.",Flight Global,0

"CFM International will not decide on increased production of its Leap programme until a delay in its existing ramp-up plan has been made up, as is targeted for later this year.

Leap production fell behind schedule earlier this year because suppliers of a ""very small number"" of parts – in particular castings and forgings – did not meet production targets, executive vice-president and general manager Sebastien Imbourg said during a briefing in London on 14 July, ahead of the Farnborough air show.

Imbourg says this was not a matter of part design or technology, but a ""first-time yield issue"": the proportion of components that had to be scrapped because they did not meet production standards was too high.

Recovery plans have been implemented, and CFM is ""now delivering at the rate we have to"", Imbourg says. But he notes that production needed to be raised as a result of the delay, in order to keep pace with scheduled increases in the ramp-up plan.

The delay in CFM's Leap delivery plan peaked at around seven weeks and has since been reduced. ""We are confident we will close the gap in 2018,"" Imbourg says.

While CFM has a dual-source policy, this has been increased to four suppliers for certain parts.

Over the full course of this year, CFM intends to deliver, for the first time, more Leap than CFM56 engines – at least 1,100 versus 1,050, respectively. ""But we are just in the middle [of the ramp-up plan],"" Imbourg says. More than 2,000 Leap deliveries are foreseen for 2020.

Airbus and Boeing are evaluating further increases in their respective A320-family and 737 production rates, but Imbourg says CFM's priority is to restore its existing ramp-up plan. He says CFM will decide in 2019 whether it can raise production further.

The Leap-1B is the sole powerplant available for the 737 Max, while the -1A competes with Pratt & Whitney's PW1100G geared turbofan on the A320neo family.

Both the Leap-1A and -1B have been affected by a premature loss of a barrier coating on high-pressure turbine shrouds made from ceramic matrix composites.

Executive vice-president and general manager Allen Paxson says ""the shroud is fine"", but the coating loss cuts exhaust gas temperature (EGT) margin and, as a result, reduces time on wing before engines require restoration.

He says CFM has been able to recertificate the engine with increased EGT margin – to boost time on wing – because the engine was tested under harsher conditions than required for the original certification.

Additionally, CFM introduced in June a modified shroud with a thinner, more durable barrier coating. Paxson says the improvements were achieved through process changes rather than reformulation of the coating.

He acknowledges that in-service engines with the original coating reached EGT margin limits. But he says the issue could be resolved through scheduled quick-turn shop visits focused on restoring the shrouds, and that affected airlines were provided with spare engines to avoid operational disruption.",Flight Global,0
"Bombardier's regional aircraft focus seems poised to shift more toward Asia and other developing markets in the coming years, in acknowledgement of aviation's advancements in those regions and the relative maturity of the North American market.

The manufacturer also expects to continue making incremental improvements to its regional aircraft products – which include CRJs and Q400s – rather than immediately embarking on larger development projects, says Bombardier president of commercial aircraft Fred Cromer.

""The products will continue to evolve. I don't think it's going to be a step change; it's more incremental,"" Cromer tells FlightGlobal. He notes Bombardier is now selling CRJs with its new Atmosphere cabin, which has larger overhead bins and a cabin designed to feel more spacious.

Cromer's was speaking on the eve of the Farnborough air show and just weeks after Bombardier returned to its regional aircraft roots after handing majority ownership of CSeries – now called the A220 – to Airbus.

With the Airbus deal complete, Bombardier has put its full weight back behind the regional aircraft that made the company famous. And Cromer sees developing markets like China as target-rich.

""There's a real need to evolve aviation in China… which is going to create opportunity for regional aircraft,"" Cromer says. Bombardier expects carriers in China will jump on the regional aircraft bandwagon much as North American airlines did decades ago.

He notes China has instituted polices designed to promote regional commercial aviation. Carriers elsewhere in Asia, and in Africa and India, will also drive much of the predicted demand, he adds, noting Bombardier recently sold aircraft to carriers like Ethiopian Airlines, SpiceJet and Philippines Airlines.

""Over the next five or 10 years, you will see… these airlines and these regions develop more feed into the infrastructure that they are building. To us that's a big opportunity,"" says Cromer.

Airlines in China will need 900 aircraft with 60-100 seats in the next 20 years, while carriers elsewhere in Asia and Oceania will need another 900 such aircraft, according to Bombardier's most-recent fleet forecast.

Bombardier pegs worldwide, 20-year demand for 60- to 100-seat aircraft at 5,750 units.

"Embraer's confidence in its E-Jet E2 offering appears to remain buoyant, as the Brazilian manufacturer maintains that its momentum will not be disrupted by its recent defeat to rival Airbus in a campaign for JetBlue Airways' business.

""We have 70 operators in 50 countries,"" Embraer commercial chief John Slattery told FlightGlobal after a media flight of the E190-E2 at the Farnborough air show. ""It's always disappointing when you lose a campaign… but one campaign doesn't create or obliterate our momentum.""

Citing demand in various regions including China, Southeast Asia and Latin America, Slattery indicates that Embraer is hopeful of announcing an E2 order at a planned press conference at the air show on 17 July.

New York-based JetBlue, which was the E190-E1's launch customer and operator, announced on 10 July that it would take 60 A220-300s to replace its 60-aircraft E190 fleet. The order came on the same day that Airbus formally rebranded the CSeries programme as the A220. Embraer had pitched the E195-E2 to JetBlue, which spent more than a year evaluating the future of its E190 fleet.

Slattery says there is nothing Embraer would have done differently with the JetBlue campaign, and that the manufacturer remains comfortable with its product positioning. He points out that JetBlue itself had praised the merits of the E195-E2.

JetBlue chief financial officer Steve Priest, who called the E195-E2 a ""fabulous next-generation aircraft"", said the race between Embraer and Airbus had been incredibly close.

""We live for the challenge,"" says Slattery of future campaigns. ""We have plenty of products in the mix.""

Embraer forecasts demand for 10,550 new deliveries in the up-to-150-seat market between now and 2037. The manufacturer estimates that 65% of these will be for growth and the rest for replacement of older jets.

The E190-E2 entered into service with Norway's Wideroe in April, and the type has so far accumulated 800 flight hours at the airline, with a utilisation of about 7h a day. Wideroe currently operates three E190-E2s, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.

"Airbus has secured extended twin-engined operations clearance beyond 3h for the A350-1000.

The -1000 is the larger of the two A350 family variants, and is powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engine.

Rolls-Royce obtained initial certification for the XWB-97 from the European Aviation Safety Agency at the end of August last year.

EASA subsequently granted 120min ETOPS approval to the A350-1000 in February this year, and 180min approval in mid-June.

But type certificate documentation from the regulator shows this was upgraded to beyond-180min clearance on 6 July.

EASA lists a maximum diversion duration of 420min for the Trent XWB-97, including 405min at maximum continuous thrust plus 15min at hold thrust.

Three A350-1000s have been delivered, comprising two for Qatar Airways – the more recent on 30 June – and a single aircraft for Cathay Pacific.

EASA approved the smaller A350-900 for beyond-180min ETOPS in October 2014.

Rolls-Royce says the Trent XWB has newly surpassed an accumulated 2 million flight hours, shortly after the company took total deliveries of the powerplant family to 500 engines.

“We have enjoyed the smoothest entry into service of any widebody engine and we continue to see the engine achieving market-leading levels of reliability,” says Trent XWB programme director Gareth Davies.

Rolls-Royce says the engine has achieved despatch reliability of 99.9% and zero in-flight shutdowns.

"Boeing is the most powerful brand in aerospace and defence. That claim may hardly be surprising, given that it is also the biggest company. In fact, according to a new survey by brand valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance, the top 10 most valuable brands in the industry belong to 10 of the largest businesses by turnover, as ranked by FlightGlobal’s Top 100. However, what is revealing is that Brand Finance reckons Boeing's brand is worth just short of $20 billion, more than $3.5 billion more than it was valued at in 2017, and almost $9 billion more than arch-rival Airbus.

The increase in the Chicago-based company’s brand equity is down to several factors, says the consultancy. These include the fact that it passed the 1,000-order mark with the 787 and commenced production of the 777X, and, just as the report was being published, announced its new joint venture with Embraer on commercial aircraft.

The reason for the gap with Airbus is largely Boeing's strong defence business at a time when military budgets are increasing in the USA and around the world, says Brand Finance.

The third-most powerful brand in aerospace is defence giant Lockheed Martin, with a value of $8.3 billion. The rest of the top 10 – General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Safran, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Raytheon, and United Technologies – have a brand value rated at between $3.4 billion and $4.7 billion. Although Brand Finance estimates that the value of each company in the top 10 has risen between 2017 and the current year, seventh-placed Rolls-Royce and ninth-placed Raytheon have slipped in the ranking.

RISING STAR

Within the top 10, aero engines to landing gear manufacturer Safran is the biggest riser, up by one-third on its 2017 value, with Brand Finance attributing some of that to the completion of its acquisition of fellow French company Zodiac Aerospace. The merger, says the consultancy, has created the world’s third-largest first-tier supplier, and is likely to drive substantial revenue growth in coming years feeding through to a ""significant increase"" in its 2018 brand value.

Every year, Brand Finance values the 25 biggest brands across several industries, including aerospace and defence. Its values are based on an estimate of what a brand owner would collect by licensing the brand on the open market. The consultancy takes into account a number of factors, such as marketing investment, stakeholder equity, and business performance, to judge what proportion of a business's revenue is down to the brand.

Outside the top 10, Rockwell Collins has seen its value soar by the most, ironic as its brand is soon to be subsumed into a new Collins Aerospace Systems unit after its takeover by United Technologies. The US company jumps from 19th in 2017 to 13th this year, with a brand value of $1.8 billion, a rise of 112%. The brand has had ""an extremely strong year"" with revenues increasing to a record $6.8 billion and a major acquisition with B/E Aerospace. The new ownership by United Technologies – itself up 14% to $3.4 billion brand value – ""is bound to have an even more transformative impact on the brand"", says the consultancy.

There are three new entrants in the Top 25, two of them from outside the main aerospace manufacturing territories of Europe and North America. These are AviChina – a holding company with a variety of aerospace interests and the first Chinese entrant in the ranking – which is placed 20th with a brand value of $933 million; Rheinmetall, the German metals and aerostructures supplier, in 22nd with a value of $862 million; and 25th-placed United Aircraft of Russia, with an estimated value of $669 million.

Only one company in the Top 25 has seen its brand value fall over the year: Italian group Leonardo, with a drop of 2% to give it a value of $1.69 billion. That may be partly a result of the extensive rebrand the company carried out in 2016, abandoning traditional trading names such as Alenia and AgustaWestland, and even its own former brand, Finmeccanica, in favour of a new divisional structure with everything from helicopters to training aircraft to defence electronics carrying the Leonardo label.

STRONG GROWTH

Brand Finance says brands in the sector grew an average of 22% over the year, faster than in the other industries it surveys. ""This was a great year for aerospace and defence brands, with a strong commercial jet market and increased planned defence spending in both the USA and globally,"" says director Savio D’Souza. ""The brands are growing bigger and are building up capacity for expansion, as in the case with UTC taking over Rockwell Collins and with Boeing's new deal with Embraer. Across the sector, we have seen steady growth, yet the balance of power remains very much the same as few brands in the league table change ranks.""

Over the six years Brand Finance has carried out the research, Boeing has been the biggest beneficiary of the largest companies in the survey, seeing its value more than double from under $10 billion in 2012. Airbus has seen its brand value drop from a peak of around $15 billion in 2014. Lockheed Martin's brand value has also more than doubled from less than $3 billion in 2012, while General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have experienced more modest growth.

"RAF FAIRFORD, England (Reuters) - Turkey’s plans to buy the Russian S-400 missile defence system would give a weapon used by “known foes” of NATO deep insight into the radar-evading F-35 fighter jets arriving in growing numbers in Europe, the top U.S. Air Force general in Europe said.

General Tod Wolters, also the NATO Allied Air Commander, told Reuters the issue was worrying, but he was working to maintain strong military ties with the NATO member for now.

“Anything that an S-400 can do that affords it the ability to better understand a capability like the F-35 is certainly not to the advantage of the coalition,” said Wolters, who was in Britain for an air chiefs conference in London and the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford.

U.S. and NATO officials want to prevent the Russian-built defence system from accumulating information about Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jets just as they are gaining a foothold in Europe.

Norway, Britain and Italy will have a total of 40 F-35s in Europe by the end of the year, with 24 more to be delivered next year and the Netherlands to receive two jets as well, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force.

Turkey’s plans to buy the Russian air and missile defence system have raised tensions with Washington, and U.S. lawmakers are seeking to block the transfer of any F-35 jets to Turkey.

A senior U.S. official last month said Turkey was a key NATO ally, but its purchases of the F-35 would be at risk and Ankara would face sanctions if it proceeded to buy the S-400.

Ankara received its first F-35 jet at the Lockheed plant in Texas last month, although the aircraft will stay in the United States for training.

“The Turks have to make a choice. They’re either going to be part of NATO or they’re going to move into the Russian camp in terms of defence,” said David Deptula, a retired Air Force general and industry consultant.

He said NATO would never integrate an S-400 system into its integrated air defence system because it would give the Russian-built system data about operating tactics and procedures that could be transferred to other users.

Operating an F-35 nearby would also allow the S-400 system to glean key information about range of detection and other characteristics of the aircraft, potentially undermining any element of surprise.

Wolters said NATO was worried about “how much, for how long and how close” any F-35s would be operated near the S-400 systems. “All those would have to be determined. We do know for right now it is a challenge.”

But he said his contacts with the Turkish air force remained “rock solid” despite the dispute over the S-400, focussing on current security threats.

“For right now, all the conversations surrounding that challenge have not hindered at all the strong relationship that we have with the Turkish air force and the great alliance that the two nations have together,” he said. “We want to make sure that for now we’re continuing on that path.”",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The United States has struck a preliminary deal to buy F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) worth about $13 billion (9.82 billion pounds), clearing the way for a larger multi-year purchase that aims to bring the cost per jet down to $80 million by 2020, sources said.

The deal for 141 F-35s lowers the price of the F-35A, the most common version of the stealthy fighter jet, to about $89 million, down around 6 percent from $94.3 million in the last deal struck in February 2017, the sources familiar with the talks said.

Bringing down the cost of the world’s most expensive defence programme is crucial to securing more orders, both in the United States and abroad.

President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticised the F-35 programme for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined in recent years as production increased.

The current “handshake” deal will be solidified along with pricing and other terms in a contract that will be announced in the coming weeks, the sources said, on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.

The agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense removes a crucial road block from the ongoing negotiations for a multi-year deal for the fighters that is expected to consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018-2020.

The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin “have made progress and are in the final stages of negotiation,” the Pentagon’s head of acquisitions Ellen Lord said in a statement, adding the two sides had reached “a handshake agreement which symbolises the Department of Defense’s commitment to equip” U.S and allied forces, while giving “great value” to the U.S. taxpayer.

Last summer, Reuters reported that F-35 customers including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain and the United States had aimed to procure 135 or more jets in fiscal year 2018 for delivery in 2020 for about $88 million per jet.

In addition, negotiations were ongoing for the multi-year U.S. deal that was said to be worth more than $37 billion, and encompassing a record 440 F-35 fighter jets.

But negotiations for this 11th batch of jets extended because new Pentagon leaders drilled deep into the programme to understand it and its costs, prolonging negotiations for the multi-year “block buy,” the sources said.

On Sunday, a Lockheed Martin representative said the handshake agreement on the production contract for the 11th lot of F-35 aircraft was in place, but the total value and cost per variant would be released when the contract was finalised.

The F-35 comes in 3 variants: the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model; the F-35B, a short take-off/vertical landing version; and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.

The F-35 programme is aiming to grow the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bring the unit price of the F-35A closer to $80 million in 2020 through efficiencies gained by ordering in larger quantifies.

The jet had production problems in 2017, but Lockheed still hit its 2017 target to deliver 66 to the United States and its allies.

Lockheed is aiming to deliver 91 jets in 2018 and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker hopes to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.

Despite the challenges the programme has faced, the jet completed its flight testing in April. In May, Israel said it had been the first country to use the fighter in combat.

New international customers are also possible. In February, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of 34 F-35s to Belgium for as much as $6.53 billion. Belgium is due to make a decision on a new fighter later this year.

General Tod Wolters, the top U.S. Air Force general in Europe and NATO’s Allied Air Commander, said the new warplane was taking root in Europe.

“It’s a game-changing system,” Wolters told Reuters ahead of the Royal International Air Tattoo military air show in England. “We’re in the process of integrating the F-35 into the complete environment, not just the airspace.”

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce (RR.L) has designed a propulsion system for a flying taxi and is starting a search for partners to help develop a project it hopes could take to the skies as soon as early next decade.

Rolls-Royce said on Sunday it had drawn up plans for an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) vehicle, or flying taxi, which could carry four to five people at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour for approximately 500 miles.

The company, which makes engines for planes, helicopters and ships, joins a variety of companies racing to develop flying taxis, which could revolutionise the way people travel.

Long the stuff of science fiction and futuristic cartoons such as “The Jetsons”, aviation and technology leaders are working to make electric-powered flying taxis a reality, including Airbus (AIR.PA), U.S. ride- sharing firm Uber and a range of start-ups including one backed by Google (GOOGL.O) co-founder Larry Page, called Kitty Hawk.

Rolls-Royce’s design will be showcased in digital form at the Farnborough Airshow, which starts on Monday. The company is looking for an airframer and a partner to provide aspects of the electrical system to help commercialise the project.

Rolls-Royce said in a statement it was well-placed to play a leading role in the “personal air mobility” market.

“The initial concept vehicle uses gas turbine technology to generate electricity to power six electric propulsors specially designed to have a low noise profile,” the company said, adding the design used its existing M250 gas turbine.

Rolls’s design would not require re-charging because the battery is charged by the gas turbine, it said, adding it could use existing infrastructure such as heliports and airports.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (EMBR3.SA) is pushing the low maintenance costs and fuel burn of its E2 jet as it battles tougher competition from the rival A220, now backed by Airbus (AIR.PA), executives said on Sunday.

“I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to present a good showing on Tuesday,” John Slattery, President and CEO Embraer Commercial Aviation, told Reuters onboard its E190-E2 jet, looking ahead to possible order announcements at this week’s Farnborough air show.

Boeing (BA.N) earlier this month struck a deal for a controlling stake in the commercial aircraft arm of Embraer under a new $4.75 billion (3.59 billion pounds) joint venture, coming after Airbus completed a deal to take control of rival Bombardier’s (BBDb.TO) Cseries programme.

Embraer was dealt a blow last week when JetBlue opted for the A220-300, formerly known as the Cseries, over the Embraer model.

Speaking separately ahead of the air show, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer said the Airbus deal allowed the former Cseries to reach its full potential.

“It’s the best aircraft in that segment. It’s a clean-sheet design, it’s not a re-engine of an existing platform,” he said, adding its benefit lay in low operating costs and fuel savings.

The E190-E2, which Embraer is showing at Farnborough with a shark painted on its nose, is the first of three new-generation aircraft in Embraer’s commercial jet line-up with new wings and new Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) engines aimed at improving fuel efficiency.

“The combination of knowledge gained from the first generation and the new technology is what makes us unique,” Rodrigo Silva e Souza, vice president marketing, Embraer Commercial Aviation, said, highlighting fuel burn and longer maintenance intervals as the main savings for operators.

The smallest version of the E2, the E175-E2 has been slowed due to a scope clause in U.S. pilots’ contracts that bars it from the U.S. regional aviation market due to its weight.

Slattery said Embraer was still planning entry into service towards the end of 2021, adding he saw opportunities outside of North America, such as replacing turboprops being flown in south-east Asia and CIS countries.

Bombardier’s Cromer said he didn’t expect the scope clause to be changed any time soon, adding that benefitted its CRJ aeroplane.

Meanwhile, U.S. carriers are still interested in the current version of the E175, Slattery said, adding that jet would continue to be produced as long as it’s required.",Reuters,0

"For all the understandable headlines around the ­arrival of aerospace’s big two in the regional jet sector, there remains an unanswered question at the heart of the issue: will Airbus and Boeing finally be the catalyst for demand in this part of the market?

When Bombardier launched what is now the A220 family in 2008, it forecast that the 100-150-seat ­segment would generate more than 6,000 deliveries over the following 20 years.

We are now halfway through that period and only about 800 aircraft in that size class (and not just the CSeries) have actually been delivered. There appears to have been a shocking analytical mistake.

Some people are sceptical about OEM forecasts but, in fact, they are remarkably accurate predictors of macroeconomic demand, with a couple of outlier exceptions. The 100-150-seat category is one such case.

For reasons that are not fully explained, the Boeing 737-700, Airbus A318, A319, Embraer 195 and, yes, the A220-100 and -300 have failed to live up to the expectations of the industry’s best economists.

It may be that their models are simply errant. It is possible that airlines simply have no need for an ­aircraft sized between a large regional jet and a medium-sized narrowbody.

Indeed, there was even a question mark over ­Airbus’s sudden optimism for the sector as it took over the CSeries, particularly because it seemed to contradict its own market outlook. Back in October, the ­European manufacturer put 20-year demand for aircraft in the A220-size class at 4,450 units – flat on previous predictions and a declining proportion of the overall narrowbody market.

On the other hand, it could be that nobody has come up with the right package – which includes not just the product, but the credibility of the manufacturer to support and sell the jets as well.

Airbus’s new ownership of the A220 family and Boeing’s tentative agreement to acquire ownership of the E195, as well as the rest of the E-Jet range will, if anything, answer the mystery of what is keeping the 100-150-seat sector from complying with the industry’s predictions.

JetBlue Airways’ order for 60 A220-300s less than 10 days after Airbus took over the programme probably indicates the answer.

The coming days at the Farnborough air show are likely to provide even more clarity.",Flight Global,0
"Boeing now plans to make a launch decision on the New Mid-market Airplane (NMA) in 2019 but remains committed to an entry-into-service date in 2025, chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said on the eve of the Farnborough air show.

The proposed concept for a 200-270-seat family of aircraft with 4,000-5,000nm range has been on Boeing's drawing boards since 2012, but the launch decision is still at least six-18 months away.

Boeing executives emphasised in the pre-air-show news conference that the six-year development schedule would be feasible if the board of directors approved the launch decision next year.

""We're also not going to be rushed to a decision,"" Muilenburg says. ""It's about pushing the future production system more than about pushing technology.""

Boeing has proposed an aircraft with a hybrid fuselage cross-section, which is generally taken to mean a wider passenger cabin and a narrower cargo bay.

"Two years have passed since the last Farnborough air show – an event that was overshadowed by the UK’s vote, weeks earlier, to leave the EU.

During those 24 months, you would think the government (actually governments, given the change of administration in 2017) might have taken the opportunity to offer a coherent vision for Brexit.

But here we are on the eve of the 2018 edition of Farnborough and the narrative is still dominated by uncertainty and political in-fighting.

Crucially, the country would remain in regulatory alignment with the European Aviation Safety Agency. But inevitably, hardline Brexiteers believe that a no-deal solution would be better than the government’s latest proposal, which leaves the UK a “vassal” state.

At some point, those visions of utopia must collide with reality. Airbus is not crying wolf when it warns of supply chain constriction and production slowdowns. And nor is the airframer bluffing when it says it will ­reconsider its presence in the UK in the event of a hard or no-deal Brexit.

"Airbus’s A330-900 is likely to obtain extended twin-engined operations approval in October, as the type's Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine closes in on certification.

The -900 is one of two aircraft in the re-engined A330neo family, and launch operator TAP Portugal's initial aircraft – on display at the Farnborough air show – has recently undertaken extensive route-proving exercises.

Rolls-Royce states that it is expecting ""imminent"" certification for the engine from the European Aviation Safety Agency, ahead of third-quarter entry into service.

Trent 7000 programme director Chris Davie says the manufacturer with then aim for ETOPS approval, with intentions for 330min clearance.

He says testing should be completed around early August. ""We'll strip the engine down, assess the components, and do that by the end of September or early October,"" he says.

Six Trent 7000s are fitted to three test A330-900s, including the TAP route-proving jet, and Rolls-Royce head of Airbus customer marketing Peter Johnston says the flight testing has progressed smoothly.

""There's a spare engine in Toulouse, but we’ve not needed it at all,"" he says. ""It hasn't even come out of its box.""

Johnston describes the Trent 7000 as a ""twin"" to the Trent 1000-TEN, combining the Trent 1000 architecture with Trent XWB technology.

While Davie is not specific about the fuel savings achieved during test flights, he says that the manufacturer is ""confident the engine meets design targets for fuel burn"".

Rolls-Royce has claimed a 10% specific fuel consumption improvement on the earlier Trent 700 for the A330. Airbus says that, once adjusted for the higher engine weight and aerodynamic improvements, the A330neo will cut fuel burn by 14%.

Airbus has landed orders for 224 A330-900s. The Trent 7000 will also power the smaller A330-800, set to begin test flights later this year.

If you’re an airline executive, you’ve likely spent a moment or two trying to decode your passengers’ complicated and often contradictory desires. In surveys, air travellers regularly cite cabin comfort and seat pitch as points of dissatisfaction, yet overwhelmingly indicate that the true driver of their purchase is ticket price.

Last year, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 28% of passengers were willing to pay more for a better seat.1

In order for airlines to keep fares low and passengers comfortable cabin interior designers are tasked with finding ways to get creative about space.

Thankfully, advances in manufacturing, modern materials and updates to all the trappings that comprise cabin interiors have brought us to a new era. As a result, airlines can now juggle the conflicting requirements of passenger satisfaction, brand differentiation and corporate profits.

1- Winning aesthetics

Passengers want to feel they are getting more value for money. In short, bright and stylish cabins create an impression of luxury and quality that leaves passengers with a greater feeling of well-being. Based on this, they may even choose the cabins of one airline over another.

New, lighter, stronger materials and aesthetically appealing cabin designs now make it more likely you can impress a passenger with a cabin environment that’s comfortable, cost-effective and customizable to suit an airline’s unique brand.

Aircraft manufacturers have taken full advantage of these new technologies in their redesigned aircraft interiors. “Our goal is to ensure that each and every passenger feels as though they are getting an upgrade on every flight,” says Patrick Baudis, Vice President of Marketing at Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. Efficient and aesthetically appealing design gives the feeling of more space.

For instance, OEMs have focused on new ways to use wall paneling to enhance the look of windows, making them appear larger. Advances in LED technology now mean that cabin lights can be mood lights too, enabling airlines to customize the cabin environment based on the time of day for a more peaceful and relaxing passenger experience.

2- Right-sized bins

More restrictive checked baggage policies have led to a crunch in the passenger cabin as fliers jockey for overhead bin space. As a result, bins are being redesigned to address this pain point for customers.

Now, even regional jets have bins that fit standard North American carry-on bags. For instance, those on Bombardier’s new Atmosphère cabin on the CRJ Series can accommodate bags that are 40% larger than typical airline dimensions. The airframer has done this without taking space away from seated passengers.

The upside here is three-fold – passengers get the space they need to bring a bag onboard; airlines don’t have the fuss, hassle and added labour cost of convincing passengers to sky check bags at the gate; and passengers are less likely to notice the difference between a mainline flight (on a bigger aircraft) and regional flight (on a smaller aircraft). The experience – from seats to overhead bins – is now more comparable.

3-Keeping everyone in mind

Putting humans at the centre of cabin design has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition. Both airframers and airlines will have to becomemore inclusive when it comes to almost everything – from seating to lavatories.

Today, even lavatories on the biggest wide-body jets can be tricky for the average passenger to access. And, for persons with reduced mobility (PRM), going to the bathroom can be daunting. A leading advocacy group for such passengers says that 52% of Americans older than 65 have some form of disability.2 These travellers must be accounted for.

Recent advances in lavatory design have allowed engineers to build wider, more accommodating doors for those who might need them. More hygienic features such as touchless faucets and anti-bacterial surfaces along with easy-to-manipulate controls improve the overall experience. From an aesthetic perspective, new lighting and optional windows make a bathroom break at 30,000 feet more appealing – for everyone.

4-Everyone means everyone

Thoughtful interior design must also take cabin crew into account. That’s why the placement of monuments and crew areas truly matters. Ensuring that flight attendants have ample room to move and that monuments in the cabin are easily accessed can reduce stress for front-line employees – and make it easier for them to deliver better-quality service.

In short, ergonomic and easy-to-use design allows an airline’s most important ambassadors to focus on passengers’ needs and promote an airline’s unique brand of service.

Still, cabin crews aren’t the only airline team members to keep in mind.

As demand for premium seats varies from route to route, it’s essential for airlines to have flexibility to maximize profitability. To solve this, some OEMs are now building easy-to-move dividers between economy and premium cabins, which means maintenance crews can easily reconfigure a cabin to meet shifting demand for seat types. Additionally, galley and cargo areas offer multiple configuration options, allowing an airline to customize aircraft to suit specific markets.

5- Keeping everyone connected

It’s predicted that, within the next three years, more than 17,000 commercial aircraft will offer passengers some form of connectivity, which is a significant increase from 6,500 aircraft in 2016. Even low-cost carriers (LCCs), once adamant that in-flight connectivity was an unnecessary frill, are acknowledging that Wi-Fi is absolutely necessary in order to compete.

Some inflight Wi-Fi providers, such as Gogo and Panasonic, are developing systems to personalize a passenger’s experience. Now, travelers can access internet and on-demand entertainment options with their handheld devices, even on regional jets, where seatback inflight entertainment (IFE) systems haven’t typically been installed. This creates even more continuity between an airline’s mainline jets and the smaller regional aircraft. Now passengers can expect everything from the smaller types that they do from the big ones.

The world of commercial aviation, from mainline to regional jets, is forever evolving to meet the requirements of ever-demanding airlines and the people who keep those airlines flying. From passengers to crew, it’s important that cabin design responds appropriately and empathetically to these demands. If done properly, it bodes well for both people and profit.

See how the human-centric cabin design in Bombardier’s new CRJ Series Cabin can enhance your brand.

"Rolls-Royce has developed a digital tool to adjust for weather-related effects on Trent XWB engine-monitoring data, aiming to prevent unnecessary maintenance.

The UK engine maker says air humidity can affect turbine gas temperature (TGT) readings, which are used along with other parameters to predict maintenance requirements.

This can make engines ""appear to need maintenance earlier than is necessary"", R-R says.

The new tool uses humidity data collected from international airports to adjust for the effect on TGT readings.

R-R says it can now ""more accurately"" plan cycles and on-wing time for Trent XWBs, and thus increase aircraft availability for operators.

The Trent XWB is the exclusive powerplant for the Airbus A350.

""We are already looking at ways to support other Trent fleets on a similar basis,"" R-R says.

The effort is part of the company's ""IntelligentEngine"" digital services initiative, launched at Singapore air show in February.

Meanwhile, the manufacturer has installed a new engine health management (EHM) system on its Pearl 15 powerplant that can measure ""thousands of parameters more than previous versions"" and is ""uniquely"" capable of responding to requests from operational centres on the ground, R-R says.

If an operational controller monitors a certain engine parameter, the EHM system can retrieve historical data of up to 200 flight hours relevant to that parameter.

""By getting that greater level of detail, instantly, our engineering teams can work out a solution much more quickly,"" says Axel Voege, head of digital operations at R-R's engine monitoring facility for business aircraft in Dahlewitz, Germany.

He adds that the EHM system can ""reach parts we haven't reached before"", including line-replaceable units.

R-R says it will ""build on this level of EHM"" for future engines across its entire civil powerplant range.

The Pearl 15 engine was unveiled at EBACE in Geneva at the end of May, and is set to power Bombardier's developmental Global 5500 and Global 6500 business jets.

"Boeing’s power requirement for the New Mid-market Airplane's engines could slightly exceed 50,000lb-thrust each, but CFM International still plans to participate in the competition, GE Aviation chief executive David Joyce has declared.

The agreement between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines sets 50,000lb-thrust as the upper limit for engines produced by the joint company.

""Europe is our immediate market, but Asia-Pacific will be for future growth. Airlines that we speak with are either looking to upguage or downguage their services.""

Alex Bellamy, chief development officer and head of the programme management division for Mitsubishi Aircraft, indicates that the manufacturer has drawn inspiration from the widebody market.

""Just look at the point-to-point model with the long-haul aircraft,"" he says. ""When you bring in a new clean-sheet that is designed and optimised for the market segment, the number of point-to-point routes also increases significantly. This is what we are trying to achieve with the MRJ.""

Since ANA placed a launch order in 2008, Mitsubishi has collected firm commitments for 213 MRJs, plus options and purchase rights spanning 174 more. The six customers include All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Air Mandalay and Aerolease. The backlog, however, is dominated by orders from two US regional carriers: SkyWest Airlines and Trans States Airlines. Those two carriers alone account for more than 70% of the total.

Trans States ordered 50 MRJ90s in 2009. SkyWest ordered 100 of the same type three years later; however, the carrier's executives have already said that they are unlikely to take delivery of the 76-seat MRJ90 because of pilot scope clauses limiting the weight of regional aircraft to 39t.

Yugo reveals that SkyWest, which also has 100 MRJ90s on option, can convert them to the smaller MRJ70 – the programme's scope-clause-compliant sister aircraft. The MRJ70, however, weighs less than 39t, but is listed with 69 seats in a standard two-class layout.

(Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Monday it won an order for 14 freight aircraft for a value of $4.7 billion, firing the opening salvo against rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA) in a contest for business on day one of the Farnborough Airshow.

Logistics group DHL placed the order for the 777 freighters and acquired purchase rights for seven more freighters, the U.S planemaker said.

Boeing and Airbus are expected to make several announcements on the first day of the July 16-22 event, as they seek to bolster their already bulging order books.

The latest order follows Boeing’s deal with FedEx Corp (FDX.N) unit FedEx Express (FDX.N) in June for 24 medium and large freighters.

While global trade tensions are escalating, the industry is counting on e-commerce continuing to soar, with more people buying products online for quick delivery.

Air freight demand is expected to increase 4 percent this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Last year was the best for cargo since 2010, with traffic growth more than doubling to 9 percent, three times the growth in capacity.

UK Business Minister Greg Clark said the new site at Sutherland on the northerly-most tip of mainland Scotland would provide facilities for vertically-launched space rockets and satellites to take off into orbit.

Under the plans announced on Monday, U.S. group Lockheed and its partners will receive 23.5 million pounds in grants from the UK Space Agency which will go towards establishing launch operations at Sutherland and developing a new system for deploying small satellites in Reading, southern England.

London-based Orbex has received 5.5 million pounds to build a new rocket launch from the site at Sutherland, which will help develop its orbital launch vehicle to deliver the small satellites into orbit.

The government said the investments were the first steps to developing a national space programme.

“We want Britain to be the first place in mainland Europe to launch satellites as part of our Industrial Strategy,” Clark said in a statement.

Britain is keen to boost its space sector at a time when it faces a challenge because of the country’s departure from the European Union next year. This has meant some UK-based companies have been excluded from future work on the EU’s 10 billion euro (£8.8 billion) Galileo satellite programme.

Britain’s space industry is considered a success story: it is growing four times faster than the rest of the UK economy and the country has a 7 percent share of the global space industry.

Funding was also provided to other sites in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall, the western tip of England, which are examining their potential for horizontal spaceports. Horizontal spaceports will be required further in the future to underpin a UK space flight market.

Small satellites used for observing conditions on the ground are the fastest growing segment of the $260.5 billion global satellite industry, according to the Satellite Industries Association.

"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will on Monday seek to reassure aviation bosses that her under-fire Brexit plan won’t disrupt their supply chains, and promise that the industry will flourish as Britain leaves the European Union.

May’s words, to be delivered at the Farnborough Airshow south west of London, come at a crunch time for the prime minister as pro-Brexit lawmakers in her party threaten revolt over an EU exit strategy they say leaves Britain subject to Brussels’ rule. [nL8N1UB03P]

“We will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. But we will do so in a way that is good for business and good for our future prosperity,” May will say, according to advance extracts of her speech.

Businesses have been getting increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity over future trading relations less than nine months before Brexit day on March 29, 2019.

Airbus (AIR.PA), Europe’s biggest planemaker which employs around 15,000 people in Britain, warned earlier this month that if Britain left the EU without a deal - a so-called “hard” Brexit - it could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded. [nL8N1U21E7]

At Farnborough, aerospace firms will be setting out wares from luxury jets to lethal drones, hoping trade tensions will not deter airlines from buying planes even as geopolitical uncertainty allows them to sell more weapons. [nL8N1UB09E]

Brexit is also likely to loom large in their conversations.

The prime minister will set out in detail how her Brexit proposal - which was agreed by cabinet earlier this month but then sparked a wave of ministerial resignations - will protect the supply chains of firms like Bombardier (BBDb.TO) and Rolls Royce (RR.L) as well as Airbus.

No specifics were provided in advance, but the government has proposed a customs arrangement that will see it closely aligned with the EU on regulations and standards under a so-called “common rule book”.

May will also announce 343 million pounds ($454 million) of investment for research and development projects, investment in electric aircraft technology, and reconfirm Britain is looking at how it can remain part of EU bodies such as the European Aviation Safety Agency.

“By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,” May will say.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Indian budget airline Spicejet (SPJT.BO) is in talks with aircraft makers over planes that would help its ambitions to fly long-haul, the carrier’s chairman said on Monday.

“We would dearly like to take passengers to Europe and the United States,” Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of Spicejet, said at an airline panel during the Farnborough Airshow.

“The question is the cost. Can we put enough seats in to get some of the advantages of short-haul low cost? Is there a model out there that we can use?”

“We are exploring that and hope we have some answers soon. We are talking to aircraft manufacturers and let’s see if we can build something out,” he added.

The rise of low-cost long-haul traveling has been led by Asian carriers such as AirAsia (AIRA.KL), as well as Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) across the Atlantic, although it remains to be seen whether it can be profitable in the long run.

Gus Kelly, the CEO of Dublin-based lessor AerCap (AER.N), agreed that one of the big questions with opting for low-cost long-haul was the seating arrangement - namely, whether the airline should invest millions in adding a premium class that they might not be able to sell for a high enough price, or stick to a plane with lots of economy seats.

“Someone will get this right,” Kelly said, adding the takeover interest in Norwegian Air Shuttle from IAG (ICAG.L) was maybe an indication that Norwegian was getting it right.

Spicejet’s Singh said there was a clear place for low-cost long-haul.

“Clearly the market exists from countries like India. In the future, I think this will be the fastest growing market in the world, especially for medium to long-haul,” he said.",Reuters,0

At the Farnborough Airshow, Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) had been earmarked to finance the programme out to 2025 and that Britain would seek international partners to provide additional funding.

The aircraft, meant to eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, will be developed and built by BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), Britain’s biggest defence company, alongside UK engine-maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L), Italian defence firm Leonardo (LDOF.MI), and European missile maker MBDA.

Unveiled before visiting foreign military chiefs and industry executives at the BAE chalet, the new jet can be flown by a pilot or operated as a drone.

Germany and France are already working on a new jet, with the program led by France’s Airbus (AIR.PA), part of the Eurofighter consortium and Dassault Aviation SA (AVMD.PA), the maker of the Rafale.

Industry executives said the two programs could eventually be fused, once Britain and the European Union sorted out Britain’s departure from the economic bloc in nine months.

Failure to unite around a single fighter programme risked further fragmenting the European defence market, but the decision was up to government leaders, Airbus’s defence chief Dirk Hoke told Reuters.

“If the politicians decide differently, we’ll have to adapt, but in my opinion that would be bad for Europe,” he said.

Leonardo Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo also voiced hope that Europe would unite around one program. “It’s up to the governments, but Europe is moving more and more towards being unified. I have to be optimistic.”

Air Vice-Marshal Simon Rochelle from Britain’s Royal Air Force said Britain was having discussions with potential partner countries, including Sweden and Japan.

He said it was not clear if the UK project would eventually be merged with the Franco-German one, adding, “We are having a lot of conversations with a lot of countries.”

Analysts see Sweden as a likely partner, although countries such as South Korea, Japan and Turkey, or Gulf arms-buying nations like Saudi Arabia, are also possibilities.

But experts say there is unlikely to be sufficient demand to support two separate European programmes, particularly given the high cost of developing a cutting-edge new aircraft.

UK plans call for the new jet to be operational by 2035, in time to replace the Typhoon fleet when it ends service in 2040.

The jet is the centerpiece of a new UK combat air strategy that Prime Minister Theresa May said was aimed at “maintaining our world-class air power capabilities.”

France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter programme that would start as a bilateral effort with Germany but could be expanded later.

The Typhoon, in contrast, was developed by the four-nation group of Germany, Spain, Britain and Italy in the 1980s.

A German defence ministry spokesman declined to comment on the UK programme, but said the Franco-German project was open to additional partners.

Michael Christie, BAE Systems strategy director for air, said Britain had the capability to develop Tempest alone but that it made sense to develop it with a partner given the cost and a desire to lock in future sales.

However, he added that BAE wanted to “play a leading role in whatever partnership that we are involved in.”

Britain has not developed a fighter jet alone since the 1960s. However, it helped develop and build the most advanced stealth fighter in the UK fleet, the U.S.-made F-35, with BAE Systems carrying out about 15 percent of the work on each jet.

Tina Kaidanow, Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow that U.S. officials were “trying to give the Turks an understanding of what we can do with respect to Patriot.” She did not say if the delegations were meeting at the air show.

Turkey had passed over the Patriot system twice in its selection process, first choosing a Chinese system, then turning to the Russian S-400 system in 2017.

Industry executives said Turkey had sought more technology transfers than Washington was previously willing to approve.

U.S. and NATO officials have repeatedly warned Ankara that the Russian system cannot be integrated into the NATO air and missile defence system, and its purchase would jeopardise Ankara’s purchase of Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets.

Assistant Secretary of Defense Kevin Fahey, the Pentagon’s most senior official weapons buyer at the show told reporters at the show that “Turkey has had an interest in Patriot, so we’ve been working for a while how we can make that work.”

Kaidanow said Washington was worried that U.S. allies purchasing Russian systems would support “some of the least good behaviour that we have seen from them (Russia) in various places including Europe but also elsewhere.”

She said Washington wanted to ensure that systems acquired by U.S. allies “remain supportive of the strategic relationship between us and our allies, in the case of Turkey that is Patriots.”

In April, the Trump administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defence industry and create jobs at home.

Wes Kremer, who heads Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems business, welcomed the Trump administration’s greater engagement on a possible sale of Patriot to Turkey.

“Turkey is an example of where this administration has engaged ... to get the U.S. systems out there,” he said.

Lockheed Martin Corp, which makes the interceptors for the Patriot system, said one approach could be to offer Turkey an open architecture system like the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) it developed with European missile maker MBDA, which would allow Turkey to integrate its own missiles.

“Turkey has a fairly well developed industrial infrastructure,” Lockheed’s top missile defence executive said. “They have their own indigenous interceptors that could be integrated, if we can move to something more of an open system.”",Reuters,0

Western arms makers are jockeying to take advantage of expanding defense budgets among NATO allies and in other regions. Shares in Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), Boeing (BA.N) and other big U.S. arms makers have seen double-digit percentage rises since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.

“We always felt like we were a company competing against countries. Now we feel like we’re a company within the United States defense industry, and that we have some sponsorship from the United States government to work these deals,” Wes Kremer, Raytheon Co.’s (RTN.N) head of Integrated Defense Systems, told Reuters at the airshow, 40 miles (60 km) southwest of London.

Many U.S. executives hope that bigger defense budgets and greater U.S. government advocacy will spur more sales, but say it may take time for the new policy to translate into orders.

“It’s very early days,” said John Bottimore, vice president of international business development at the U.S. unit of Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L). “It’s too early to say it’s making a difference yet.”

The U.S. State Department on Monday hailed the implementation of the Trump administration’s new weapons export policy, days after Trump pressured NATO allies at a meeting in Brussels to boost their military spending.

The State Department said the new policy was “a whole-of-government effort to expedite transfers” that support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives.

The changes, first rolled out in April, are aimed at expanding sales to allies, bolstering the American defense industry and creating jobs at home.

The Aerospace Industries Association, the biggest U.S. arms industry lobbying group, welcomed Monday’s announcement, made by senior State Department official Tina Kaidanow.

“We are gratified to see our recommendations for strategic focus, whole of government coordination, and enhanced accountability feature prominently,” AIA’s CEO Eric Fanning said in a statement.

Kaidanow told reporters the U.S. was working with NATO ally Turkey on the possible sale of a Patriot system to halt Ankara’s plans to buy a Russian-made S-400 system that has sparked serious concerns.

Raytheon’s Kremer said Turkey showed how the Trump administration was already making a difference.

During those seven decades, there have been some remarkable pieces of hardware and technology exhibited while the industry’s top pilots have wowed the crowds manoeuvring their machinery through some impressive flying displays.

Organised by what was originally dubbed the “Society of British Aircraft Constructors”, the SBAC air show made its debut at Farnborough in 1948. This was in fact the ninth SBAC show, with the event having begun at Hendon in North London in 1932 as the “New Types Park” within the annual Royal Air Force Pageant.

In 1936 the annual event moved to the nearby de Havilland airfield, Hatfield, but there was to be only one more show before the onset of war. The first post-war show was held in 1946 at the Handley Page works at Radlett – again a north London location. It remained there for one year be-fore taking up a residence which continues to this day at what was then the Royal Aircraft Estab-lishment field at Farnborough.

Since that debut event in 1948 there have been many memorable moments across the decades.

We’ve delved into the FlightGlobal archives to flashback to some of the interesting aircraft and events from the past 70 years.

1948 First Farnborough

The industry gathered during the sunny – if slightly windy – first week of September 1948 for the inaugural show at the Hampshire airfield. Flight wrote in our show report: “That the Ministry of Supply airfield at Farnborough, Hants, should have been made available for the 1948 Display and Exhibition of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors is a matter for congratulation of the Society and for thanks to the Ministry.”

We were clearly supportive of the decision to relocate to Farnborough: “Adoption of the new ven-ue – which imposes fewer traffic restrictions than Radlett and, more important, allows the long-proposed admittance of the public – should swell the Exchequer by promoting export sales, bene-fit British prestige and stimulate public morale.”

Among the notable aircraft on display was the Armstrong Whitworth AW52 flying wing. Almost as large as an Avro Lancaster bomber, it was envisaged that this jet-powered design would eventually be developed into an airliner.

1949 Comet cometh

FlightGlobal archive

The industry had its first glimpse of future air travel when the de Havilland Comet jet airliner de-buted at Farnborough in 1949. Flight could hardly contain its excitement when describing the sleek airliner’s display: “A fast, hushed run across the airfield was followed by a wide, low-level turn at slow speed, which revealed in full a degree of grace never before achieved in the design of so large an aircraft. Although it flew for the first time only on July 27th, development flying has pro-gressed rapidly and a Mach number of 0.8 has already been reached at altitude.”

1950 Bristol’s behemoth

Farnborough began its long-running tradition in 1950 of being “the land of the giants” when the huge Bristol Brabazon airliner made its debut.

Displayed alongside the Comet, Flight described the two machines as sharing the distinction of be-ing the most widely discussed airliners to be produced by any nation since the war.

“There are solid technical reasons for such fame and both aircraft give an immediate impression of beauty and efficiency,” said Flight. “The stately Brabazon prototype, powered by coupled Centau-rus piston engines, is the forerunner of a later version with Proteus turboprops, specifically de-signed for long-range operation – in particular, nonstop between London and New York.”

The show also featured more new engine technology demonstrations, with Vickers showing off its modified Viscount equipped with Rolls-Royce Tay turbojets installed in a configuration that would later be mimicked by the Boeing 737-100/200.

1952 Avro arrival

The 1952 event witnessed a remarkable debut display by Avro’s new delta bomber just days after its first flight. But the tragic crash of the de Havilland DH110 into the spectator area was the abiding memory of this show.

FlightGlobal Archive

Flight described the first public appearance of what would become the Vulcan as “an occasion which promises to become historic”, declaring the futuristic aircraft had “stolen the show and opened the eyes of the world”.

Saunders Roe’s giant Princess flying boat also graced the skies, flying over from the waters of So-lent each day. Although it appeared to be nostalgic blast from the past, this 100-seat double-decker powered by 10 Bristol Proteus turboprops, had only completed its maiden flight the previ-ous month. Sadly, its impressive display in the Farnborough skies did nothing for its sales prospects as the world had moved on from sea- to land-planes.

1958 Roto dynamics

The Fairey Rotodyne “heli-liner” was the star attraction at the 1958 Farnborough which made its public debut. With its “tip-jet” powered rotors, FIight described the unusual aircraft as sounding like “a paddle-steamer as it starts up” but said it “proves itself a liner in every sense”.

The display involved the Rotodyne rising vertically as a helicopter and hovering briefly before re-tracting its undercarriage and setting off. “Translation from helicopter to autogiro flight is made at about 1,000ft and at a speed of 115mph,” said Flight. “It passes the enclosure at perhaps 170mph – in any case at a speed in excess of the world helicopter record of 162mph.”

1962 Jumping Jet

Vertical take-off was the big talking point at Farnborough 1962, as Hawker’s P1127 made its debut. This single-seater, which was the precursor to the Harrier, began what would become a long-standing tradition of the British V/STOL jet wowing air-show crowds.

Associated Newspapers/REX/Shutterstock

This show, which was also the last time it was held annually, was an important one for the UK’s civil aircraft programmes with the de Havilland Trident, Vickers VC10 and DH125 business jet all making their maiden appearances.

W/C Ken Wallis also debuted his single-seat autogyro which would go on to find fame as 007’s cho-sen form of air transport – dubbed “Little Nellie”– in You only live twice.

1966 Red dawn

From 1966, foreign aircraft were allowed to participate at the Farnborough air show with the one proviso – that they had British powerplants or major components.

FlightGlobal Archive

This move permitted aircraft like the Rolls-Royce-powered Aermacchi MB326 trainer and Fokker F27 turboprop to make their first appearances.

But making their debut – and a Farnborough favourite ever since – were the nine brightly-coloured Hawker Siddeley Gnat T1s of the Royal Air Force aerobatic display team, The Red Arrows, led by the legendary Sqn Ldr Ray Hanna.

1970 Sonic tonic

As the industry moved into the 1970s, speed and size were dominating the airliner sector. Con-corde had begun flight-testing in April the previous year, so the elegant machine was well into its trials programme by the time it made its debut at Farnborough.

FlightGlobal Archive

The British-built Concorde prototype 002 made a triumphant arrival each day over the Farnborough skies, being flown in by Brian Trubshaw and John Cochrane from its Fairford flight-test base. The slender delta would go on to wow Farnborough crowds for many years to come.

1972 Flying triangles

FlightGlobal archive

The debut of the Saab Viggen in 1972 gave the crowd something to get excited about. Flight de-scribed the “double-delta” fighter as giving “a searing demonstration” as it rolled around the Farn-borough sky. Lockheed was keen to show off its new widebody, the TriStar as the Rolls-Royce RB211-powered trijet had already been chosen by two UK airlines including national carrier BEA in whose colours it was exhibited.

1974 Black beauty

Lockheed’s rocket ship, the SR-71 Blackbird, was the talk of Farnborough 1974. Flight recorded the Mach 3 aircraft’s arrival thus: “The opening curtain is stolen by the Americans, whose SR-71 lands from New York as the President’s international guests gather for the flying display. A note passed to Sir Harry Broadhurst and SBAC director Sir Richard Smeeton simply says: ‘1 hr 55 min 45 sec’. Fif-teen hundred pressmen have their show-opening story.”

If speed wasn’t your thing, the Lockheed line-up still had something to offer in the form of the show’s largest-ever exhibit – the giant C-5 Galaxy military airlifter.

1982 Twinjet tussle

Transatlantic rivalry in the civil aviation field ratcheted up at Farnborough ’82 when Airbus and Boe-ing’s new widebody twins went head-to-head. The A310 was flying the flag for Europe while Boe-ing brought the 767 – along with its narrowbody sibling the 757 – as the rivals battled for sales su-premacy in a key market.

FlightGlobal archive

The excitement on the military side was created by Rockwell’s big swing-wing bomber, the B-1A. The programme had been salvaged by the recently inducted President Reagan and Rockwell brought the fourth prototype out of storage for its Farnborough sojourn.

1986 Fighter foes

The star attractions at the 1986 show were the British Aerospace Experimental Aircraft Programme (EAP) and Dassault Rafale fighters. In our show preview, Flight pointed out that in the fighter-export market the UK and France were the closest and fiercest rivals. “That rivalry is epitomised at Farnborough by the presence of the EAP and Rafale technology demonstrators,” said Flight. “These new aircraft which flew within a month of each other this summer, are not only the begin-nings of Europe’s future fighters but also embody France and Britain’s future export hopes.”

FlightGlobal archive

The EAP would feed into the development of the Eurofighter, but Farnborough attendees would have to wait another decade before seeing the Europe’s jointly developed interceptor perform in the flying display.

Meanwhile as Airbus prepared to redefine commercial airliner thinking with its sidestick-equipped, fly-by-wire A320 (which debuted in 1988), it showed off the technology’s capabilities with an im-pressive display by its A300 development aircraft. “The crew concentrated on showing the wind-shear stall protection which computerised control gives at the bottom end of the flight envelope by flying at devastatingly high angles of attack with apparent ease and safety,” wrote Flight.

1988 Bypass operation

McDonnell Douglas brought its MD-80 ultra-high-bypass (UHB) demonstrator to Farnborough for the first public demonstration of the propfan-powered aircraft. Flight reported that McDonnell Douglas aimed to use the GE-powered demonstrator “in the evenings to take up potential cus-tomers for its UHB-powered MD-90 series”. But that plan was not a success and three decades on, propfan-powered airliners resolutely remain an aspiration rather than a reality.

FlightGlobal archive

The Soviets turned up in force in 1988, with the giant Antonov An-124 Ruslan airlifter making its de-but alongside two MiG-29 fighters, which Flight described as “perhaps the biggest crowd-pullers at this year’s Farnborough” in our show report, adding: “The Soviet Union’s decision to exhibit the aircraft was given maximum backing, and a high ranking delegation from the Mikoyan design bu-reau (OKB) was on hand to answer questions about the aircraft.”

1996 Eurofighter debut

Associated Newspapers/REX/Shutterstock

This was the year that the Eurofighter finally made its long-awaited debut at Farnborough, with a thundering flying display to show off the new interceptor’s impressive performance. A decade af-ter Farnborough crowds had a glimpse of the technology with the BAe EAP and after years of mak-ing do with plastic mock-ups, the British prototype DA2 was finally able to show off its airborne ca-pabilities.

2006 Big wing

The biggest aircraft to ever appear at Farnborough made a triumphant flypast on its debut in 2006 as Airbus test pilot Peter Chandler in the A380 led the Red Arrows down the crowd line as UK prime minister Tony Blair looked on. The A380, which was in the midst of its flight-test programme, head-ed off at the conclusion of the show to carry out high-energy rejected take-off trials.

2012 Boeing’s back

After an absence for a generation – in fact 13 Farnborough air shows – a Boeing airliner was back in the flying display in 2012. The first 787 Dreamliner for Qatar Airways was put through its paces each day with an impressive demonstration. Boeing’s long-held view had been that airliners aren’t de-signed to be shown off at air shows and flying them in displays didn’t sell aircraft. But when Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker stated his desire for his new jet to be shown off at Farn-borough, who was Boeing to deny him?

2016 Late strike

Two years later than planned, the Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter made its show debut in 2016. The JSF had originally been expected in 2014, but a technical issue forced a US Department of Defense grounding in the run-up to the show. The UK’s first F-35B was displayed at Farnborough 2016, joined by two US Marine Corps examples.

2018 Tempest Two

The unveiling of a full-scale model of the “Tempest” concept on the opening day provided a vision for the UK's next-generation fighter. The aircraft which, like the Eurofighter Typhoon, adopts an RAF heritage fighter name, bolsters the UK Ministry of Defence's new Future Combat Air strategy.

The 2018 show also featured the flying-display debut of Mitsubishi’s new MRJ regional jet, although plans for the aircraft to appear everyday were hampered after a ground-handling incident on day two.

Price of progress: tragedy strikes

Tragedy struck Farnborough in 1952 when de Havilland’s handsome new supersonic fighter, the DH110, disintegrated and crashed into the spectator area.

The accident happened during the display after the DH110’s supersonic arrival from de Havilland’s Hatfield plant. The two crew were killed, including distinguished test pilot John Derry DFC and his observer Tony Richards, as well as 29 members of the public. A further 60 were injured – many on-ly slightly – by parts of the aircraft.

Our report on the accident explained how the break-up appeared to begin just before a steep 90˚ turn towards the enclosures: “Small fragments came away from the 110, which gained height as the two Avons and the nose became detached from the airframe. One engine fell on a crowded slope behind the caravan parks, causing most of the casualties; the other landed harmlessly farther south.”

Flight summed up the industry’s mood immediately after the tragedy in its leading article: “Seldom has the truth of the reflection that ‘such is the price of progress’ been demonstrated with such appalling effect.”

A faulty leading-edge design was blamed for the accident. The redesigned DH 110 returned to the air in June 1953 and was eventually developed into the successful Sea Vixen naval fighter. The acci-dent resulted more stringent safety measures at air shows preventing aircraft from operating too close to the crowd line.

In 1984 the crowd got to witness another dramatic event in the flying display, but this time thank-fully without a tragic outcome. A steep descent by the de Havilland Canada Buffalo to demonstrate its short-landing capability ended in a fiery crash as the transport hit the runway hard and disinte-grated. The only harm suffered was to the crew’s pride, as the investigation pointed to “an error of judgement by the aircraft commander”.",Flight Global,0
"Mitsubishi has disclosed that the MRJ90 it brought to the Farnborough air show for flight demonstrations has sustained damage to its radome.

The airframer said the incident occurred on 16 July, after the debut flight demonstration of FTA-3 (JA23MJ), as the aircraft was being pushed back to the static line.

Alex Bellamy, chief development officer and head of the programme management division for Mitsubishi Aircraft, tells FlightGlobal that the damage was caused by the local ground-handling company, and that flight demonstrations scheduled for 17 July will be suspended.

There were no injuries in the incident.

""One of the ground-handling vehicles struck the radome of our aircraft after landing. There was a lot of repositioning of the aircraft,"" says Bellamy. ""There was a significant impact to the radome... There was a penetration through the radome, almost like a crack in the radome. There were witness marks of the paint from the vehicle on the radome itself.""

The Japanese airframer is in the process of deciding whether to pull a replacement radome for FTA-3 from a test aircraft based in Nagoya or at Moses Lake in the US state of Washington.

Future flight testing of the MRJ is ""not affected at all"", says Mitsubishi.

"The Boeing 747 may have been absent from the Farnborough air show during its heyday in the 1970s, but this year there two jumbos have turned up.

Max Kingsley-Jones/FlightGlobal

Following the 747’s debut appearance in freighter form at Farnborough 2016, there are two -8Fs among the logistics transport exhibits in the show’s dedicated Cargo Village area.

A Qatar Airways 747-8F is one of five aircraft on show by the airline group at Farnborough, while strategic freight partners CargoLogicAir, Volga-Dnepr and AirBridgeCargo have a 747-8F and an Antonov An-124 present.

Farnborough’s Cargo Village is a dedicated static-display area which features demonstrations and a showcase for logistics capabilities. In addition, this year’s show has a 1,000m2 exhibition hall dedicated entirely to air cargo located close by, housing up to 20 exhibitors from the air-cargo supply chain.

"Advanced electric systems under development by companies such as UTC Aerospace Systems will enable the aviation industry to develop and certificate an electrically powered passenger aircraft within 10 years.

That is the prediction of UTAS's president of electric, environmental and engine systems, Tim White, who is using Farnborough to highlight the company's advancements in electric power.

The electric aircraft envisioned by White is powered by hybrid-electric engines. Think a Toyota Prius – except the engine will turn fans or propellers, not wheels, he says.

It will likely carry no more than 20 passengers and have range of less than 500nm (926km), he adds.

White sees such advances as within reach, citing his company's ongoing work to develop improved electric aircraft systems.

UTAS has already spent some $3 billion on so-called ""more electric"" initiatives – a concept meaning to replace hydraulic and pneumatic aircraft systems with electric systems, which are more efficient and require less maintenance, White says.

The company has already developed electric versions of environmental control systems, flight control systems and nitrogen generators, White says. Aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-35, Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 and A380 already have such systems, he says.

Because new aircraft demand increasing amounts of electricity, UTAS is also developing improved generators, including systems that generate twice as much power by weight as existing generators, White says.

The company is also studying improved means of controlling energy and ways to improve the safety of electrical systems, including the safety of lithium ion batteries, he says.

In addition to hybrid-electric technology, engineers in White's field are working on ""electrification of turbine engines"", which means using electric power to supplement engine thrust in certain phases of flight.",Flight Global,0

"The global aerospace industry in 2017 was worth $838 billion, with US industry accounting for 49% of the total, according to a new report from the Teal Group and Aerodynamic Advisory.

The proportion of the aerospace industry accounted for by US is growing due to rising orders for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the report says. French industry took an 8% share of the global industry, with Airbus and Dassault Aviation putting the nation close to the top of the table.

Chinese companies are steadily gaining ground, and were in third place with 6% of the total. The nation also had the largest aerospace trade deficit in the world.

“Efforts to replicate Western vertical supplier bases for indigenous development programs [in China] represent a very expensive and risky approach to industry development,” the report says, noting that overall, Chinese companies had very high levels of expenditure and employment, while generating very low levels of productivity, output and profit.

Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin may grab the headlines, but the report shows that original equipment manufacturers and sub-tier manufacturers accounted for 54% of all global economic activity. The maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade sector represented 27% of economic activity.

The aerospace industries of the top ten countries were worth $731 billion – 87% of the global industry. The 49% of the world aerospace total accounted for by the US was more than the next 25 countries combined.

The top 10 aerospace manufacturing countries in 2017 were: 1. US at $408 billion; 2. France at $69 billion; 3. China at $61.2 billion; 4. United Kingdom at $48.8 billion; 5. Germany at $46.2 billion; 6. Russia at $27.1 billion; 7. Canada at $24 billion; 8. Japan at $21 billion; 9. Spain at $14.4 billion, and 10. India at $11 billion.

"One of the biggest mergers in recent aerospace history – UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS) and Rockwell Collins – will not have quite crossed the line by the time the Farnborough air show starts, but Dave Gitlin, who heads UTAS and is set to become number two at Collins Aerospace Systems, is “champing at the bit” to launch the combined business into the industry. “We have been working very closely with Kelly [Ortberg, current Rockwell Collins chief executive and the designate to take on that role at CAS] and his team, so we can hit the ground running,” he says. “We have a plan in place on how we are going to work with our customers on day one. We’re ready and we’re excited.”

In March, Boeing dropped its objection – one of the final potential obstacles to the $30 billion deal – after negotiating new cost-reduction agreements with the two companies. The relationship with UTAS had been dealt a blow when Boeing dropped Goodrich – acquired by United Technologies in 2011 – as its landing gear supplier on the 777X on cost grounds, and handed the contract to small Canadian player Heroux-Devtek. UTAS has since fought its way back into Boeing’s affections, securing more contracts on the revised 777. The new arrangements will also allow UTAS to negotiate for work on Seattle’s upcoming New Mid-Market Airplane that could enter service in the mid-2020s.

UTAS and Rockwell Collins are two of the biggest first-tier suppliers in the industry. Charlotte-based UTAS – whose parent company also owns Pratt & Whitney and formed in 2015 from the merger of the former Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand units – produces a wide range of components, from nacelles to ejection seats, and landing gear to laser warning systems. Rockwell Collins, based in Cedar Rapids with revenues of around $8.3 billion, is, with Honeywell, one of the two big suppliers of cockpit avionics, communication equipment and cabin entertainment systems. Although UTAS and Rockwell Collins both compete in business aircraft interiors, their product portfolios are largely complementary.

The big incentive for the merger was Rockwell Collins’ suite of technologies at a time when big data, passenger connectivity and cockpit innovation are advancing apace. Just before its offer for Rockwell Collins, United Technologies had divested Sikorsky, a $7.5 billion sales business, to Lockheed Martin for a figure just $1.5 billion greater than that sum. The price it offered for Rockwell Collins – $30 billion – valued the avionics and interiors company at three-and-a-half times its annual revenues. That suggests United Technologies believes it can extract a lot more return from both Rockwell Collins’ existing product line, and the synergies offered by the marriage with UTAS.

One of the keys to that is “the connected aircraft” – a push to link the aircraft, its flightcrew and passengers with the ground in real time, whether that is giving a traveller access to movies and social media on the internet, providing pilots with instant updates on weather conditions or upcoming traffic, or recording, transmitting and interpreting data on every aspect of the aircraft’s performance as it flies. “Data and digital is where there is the potential for the most disruptive change in our industry,” says Gitlin. “So it is perfect timing as we come together with Rockwell Collins.”

On that theme, at Farnborough UTAS will announce the opening of its Intelligent Aircraft Technologies Lab in Rockford, Illinois. The company says the initiative is “dedicated to the accelerated development of more intelligent and connected aircraft systems, ultimately optimising airline operational efficiency, while providing new insights for the design and manufacturer of highly reliable products”. One of its aims will be to “demonstrate the secure and efficient movement of data from components and systems across and airline’s network to enable intelligent connected aircraft fleets”.

The lab will develop health monitoring solutions and early warning systems, initially for generators, air compressors, fans, and motor controllers – but UTAS plans to “quickly expand” into other components. Data, says Mauro Atalla, vice president of engineering and technology, sensors & integrated systems, is “the transformative force for higher levels of operational efficiency and innovative product designs”. He adds: “With technology we have developed over the past several years, we are able to access thousands of parameters from fleets of new and older aircraft. With our new lab to advance our capabilities, we are on the pathway to a truly connected, intelligent aircraft for our customers.”

Gitlin points to a concrete example of how big data has helped one customer, Alaska Airlines, reduce costs by millions of dollars a year by adjusting trajectories and take-off and descent patterns, based on detailed analysis of aircraft performance. “Just by doing that, they saved a million gallons of fuel a year,” he says. In another example, UTAS has been working with a “major airline” to assess vibratory and thermal trends on a generator to detect any upcoming failures. By using machine learning and statistical analysis in this way to identify looming failures in components before they happen, carriers can vastly reduce delays and cancellations, he adds. “It’s all about understanding our own equipment to keep our products on wing for longer.”

Once the Rockwell Collins deal goes through, UTAS can enhance that offering by using its communications know-how to consolidate all that data in a single device and disseminating it during the flight, says Gitlin. Under the merger plans, the rest of the Rockwell Collins portfolio will be brought together with UTAS’s product line-up under six new business units, based on “product areas that create natural P&Ls [profit and loss units]” rather than market sectors. Synergies will come by “working together on the supply chain and MRO support”, he says.

While UTAS has taken flak for not adjusting prices quickly enough under pressure from aircraft manufacturers – the loss of the 777X landing gear being the most significant warning shot – Gitlin says negotiating with OEMs to reduce costs “is nothing new”. He adds: “We are working hard with Boeing and others on solutions. They are under pressure from their airline customers and we expect to have more strategic discussions on how we grow our businesses together. We are aligning technology roadmaps, understanding their future programmes, and finding the right win-wins. We know we have to be competitive to win business, but technology differentiation matters too, and we are making the right investments to have the lowest cost, highest performance products on the market.”

As the currently-branded UTAS goes into the Farnborough air show, Gitlin says he is “more positive about this industry and where we are positioned than I have ever been”. He adds: “Airlines are up, defence budgets are increasing. We have a watch on fuel prices, but all the macro indicators are very strong. We are well positioned to benefit from all the trends. Aircraft are becoming more electric, and we have a world-leading electric systems business. They are becoming more autonomous, and we have the best portfolio there of any systems supplier. I am extremely excited about how we can be at the heart of these macro trends and really capitalise on them.”",Flight Global,0
"Pratt & Whitney is confident it will meet the ramp-up demands for its geared-turbofan narrowbody engines, despite issues earlier this year that temporarily halted deliveries of the PW1100G to Airbus for the A320neo family.

Speaking at the Farnborough air show on 16 July, the US engine maker's president Bob Leduc said it was now ""on schedule"" with engine deliveries.

""We are all caught up,"" he says. ""The problems we had over the last few years are behind us.

""We are on schedule and will ramp up on schedule.""

Leduc's comments were echoed by Greg Hayes, chief executive of parent company United Technologies, who says it will achieve ""rate 63"" for Airbus ""at some time next year"".

With both airframers considering taking narrowbody production to 70 aircraft per month or higher, there are concerns as to whether the supply chain can support that increase.

Hayes says the issue for Pratt & Whitney is whether it can ""make investments fast enough to satisfy [the airframers'] demands"".

He stresses: ""There's no technical reason that we can't do it; it's simply an issue of supply-chain constraints.""

But Leduc believes the engine suppliers have not been given enough credit for achieving higher output in relatively little time.

""It took Airbus and Boeing 30 years to get to rate 60: the engines companies are going to do it in 30 months. No-one ever seems to want to talk about that piece.""

"Paul Eremenko, the newly appointed chief technology officer of United Technologies, is already making his mark on the company, with the revelation that it is working on a hybrid-electric demonstrator programme, as well as launching a new rapid prototyping and development unit.

Eremenko, speaking at the Farnborough air show today, said the company is developing a number of hybrid-electric flight demonstrators, as the company looks ahead to future propulsion systems.

However, he says it will be a ""couple more months"" before it is ready to reveal details on the experimental aircraft.

In addition, the new unit – called UTC Advanced Projects – will be a ""Skunk Works-type"" outfit, and will operate in a ""fast-paced, risk-tolerant environment at the heart of UTC"", behaving more like a start-up than a traditional aerospace company.

He says it will work across the whole of the company, rather than being confined to a single division like the recently established Gator Works operation at its Pratt & Whitney military engines business.

Eremenko joined UTC earlier this year after a two-year stint as CTO at Airbus. Prior to that, he held roles at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Google Alphabet.

He says that the rapid pace of improvement seen in the power density of electrical components offers the ""tantalising possibility"" of all-electric aircraft in the future.

A separate electric systems unit inside UTC Aerospace Systems is building a high-voltage electrical systems lab in Rockford, Illinois, where it will be able to validate a 1MW generator, four times as powerful as the units it makes for the Boeing 787.

""We are investing heavily in more-electric [architectures],"" says Dave Gitlin, president of UTAS.

"Tianjin Haite Aircraft Engineering and ExecuJet have extended their co-operation agreement to provide service and support of a range of business jets at a dedicated facility located at Binhai International airport in Tianjin, China. The two-year deal was marked at a dedicated signing ceremony on Tuesday, where Li Biao, chairman of the Tianjin Haite parent company Haite Group, declared that the venture “continues to develop in line with China’s business aviation growth”.

Haite joined forces with ExecuJet in 2010 to develop business aircraft support infrastructure at the airport, 100km (62 miles) southeast of Beijing. The venture, known as ExecuJetHaite, marked the first foray into this niche sector for the Chengdu-headquartered conglomerate – which operates a number of businesses throughout the whole aviation supply chain, including aircraft component manufacture, airliner maintenance, repair and overhaul along with pilot and cabin crew training.

“We brought a popular business aviation brand and expertise to the table, while Haite provided the funding,” says Graeme Duckworth, executive vice-president of ExecuJet parent company Luxaviation. “We are now one of the largest and most successful business jet MRO facilities in China.”

ExecuJetHaite is approved to provide maintenance on aircraft registered in the Cayman Islands, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Macau and the USA. It is also an authorised service centre for Dassault’s Falcon 7X, Embraer’s Legacy 650, Phenom 100/300 and Bombardier’s Global and Challenger families. “We are also approved to perform maintenance on out-of-warranty Gulfstream business jets including the G450 and G550; and offer line support on the Boeing Business Jet and Airbus Corporate Jetliner families”, says Duckworth.

ExecuJetHaite is looking to expand to other key cities in China to take advantage of the country’s thriving corporate aircraft market. “As China’s economy grows, so will the numbers of corporate jets,” says Li. “We would like to establish maintenance facilities in cities which have the strongest economic and population growth is expected.” Destinations under consideration include Guangzhou, Chengdu, Beijing and Hangzhou, he says.

"Boeing's annual update to a running 20-year forecast suggests the industry's strong demand cycle shows no sign of slowing over the long term.

The company's current market outlook predicts that passenger demand will grow by 4.7% per year over the next 20 years, reflecting the same growth outlook as in Boeing's forecast last year.

That growth will drive demand for 42,700 aircraft deliveries, with a total market value of $6.1 trillion over the forecast period, or an annual average of 2,135 aircraft, including regional jets, single-aisles, widebodies and freighters.

Demand continues to be led by the narrowbody market, accounting for 73% of total deliveries, or 3,160 aircraft. Boeing also expects airlines to take delivery of 8,070 widebodies in the period up to 2037, a 19% share of the deliveries. Another 2,320 regional jets, or 5% of the total, will also be delivered, Boeing forecasts.

Deliveries of new freighters will total 980 aircraft over the forecast period, Boeing says. It adds that another 1,670 aircraft will be converted from passenger airliners to freighters.",Flight Global,1
"Sukhoi Civil Aircraft (SCAC) is looking to invest heavily in European customer-support facilities as it seeks to improve its chances of selling more Superjets to airlines outside Russia.

""It is a lesson we have learnt, to make sure that airlines are fully satisfied with our aircraft. This includes training facilities, improved spare-part supplies and MRO facilities,"" SCAC president Alexander Rubtsov tells FlightGlobal.

He did not specify the countries in which SCAC could invest, but says: ""A decision will be made by the end of the year.""

Rubtsov adds that these facilities will be part of a larger network that would also support fellow Russian-built commercial aircraft like the Irkut MC-21 and CRAIC CR929 when those are introduced to the market.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that if Russia is excluded, Europe has just one Superjet customer: Irish regional carrier CityJet, which has seven in service, including five operated for Brussels Airlines.

However, Rubtsov laments that parts are sourced from outside Russia, which make up 80% of the total, ""can be too expensive"". The airframer is looking to source more components domestically.

""These are parts where we see room for improvement in weight, performance and in price. We are looking at Russian-made interiors, APUs, wheels and brakes, wiring systems, navigation systems,"" adds Rubtsov. ""Our focus today is on quality, instead of quantity.""

Sukhoi's civil aircraft division is forecasting sales of 345 Superjet 100s, including the business-jet version, over the period to 2030.

Most of these aircraft will be sold in Russia and the former Soviet states, the airframer expects, as well as Southeast Asia and Latin America.

Sanctions have been placed on Sukhoi and several other Russian aerospace companies under the USA's ""Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act"". However, SCAS is not covered by the sanctions and remains upbeat on the Superjet's sales prospects.

Rubtsov says the airframer is ""on track"" to produce 30-35 aircraft per year.

""The Superjet is built for the global market, because the Russian market is too small. The market requires some level of flexibility in terms of combination of value, comfort, dispatch reliability and customer satisfaction.""

This story has been updated to clarify both that the US sanctions do not apply to SCAC and that the five Superjets operating for Brussels Airlines are CityJet aircraft

"Airbus is working on a further A350-1000 range increase which Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker expects will create a ""huge competitor"" to the aircraft's rival, the Boeing 777-300ER.

The European manufacturer recently boosted the -1000's maximum take-off weight by 5t (11,000lb) to 316t, which is available on all aircraft through paperwork changes and does not include any fuel-capacity increase.

Al Baker says Airbus has disclosed plans to Qatar Airways for a further weight increase, along with additional fuel capacity.

""They are going to increase the MTOW shortly, and then there will be a second increase... which will be a very huge competitor for the -300ER, from what we can see,"" he says.

This second increase will be available ""in the mid-term"", adds Al Baker.

""It's a very promising aeroplane. They have told us they can increase the range of the -1000 by putting in additional tanks.""

Sources indicate that the weight increase under study is a 3t increase to 319t available from around 2020, suggesting that structural changes could be required rather than simply paperwork. With the current highest MTOW of 316t, the A350-1000 has a range of 8,400nm (15,540km).

It is not clear how much additional range the new MTOW and fuel capacity will provide, or whether the plan requires additional thrust from the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97, currently rated at 97,000lb thrust (432kN).

Airbus declines to comment about the specifics of any proposed changes, saying only that it is ""always looking at developments and talk to airlines about possible improvements"".

It is possible the proposed -1000 improvements could be part of studies into an A350 variant in response to the Qantas ""Project Sunrise"" request for an ultra-long-range aircraft. Airbus has previously confirmed it is examining A350 developments to meet the Qantas requirement but declined to disclose whether these would be based on the -900 airframe or the larger -1000.

Boeing's response is likely to be based on the 777-8 platform, which is sized between the -900 and -1000.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Planemakers racked up more than $20 billion (15.08 billion pounds) of deals on the opening day of the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, suggesting demand for new passenger jets remains in rude health despite worries over trade tensions and Brexit.

The deal-making came as host Britain tried to convince a sceptical aerospace industry about its plans to leave the European Union, saying supply chains would continue to run smoothly and pledging money for a new fighter jet programme.

European jetmaker Airbus (AIR.PA) and U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) have been enjoying an almost decade-long boom thanks to rising emerging markets growth and a need among Western airlines to upgrade their fleets, and order books are bulging.

Higher oil prices, rising interest rates, global trade tensions and uncertainty over Brexit have all raised concerns that demand may slow.

But business was brisk on the first day of the July 16-22 air show, though analysts will be watching closely to see how many of the deals are new, and how many involve adjusting earlier business or switching models - something not always easy to spot at first.

Even before the first displays had taken to the skies over a sun-baked southern England, Boeing said delivery firm DHL, part of Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPWGn.DE), had placed a $4.7 billion order for 14 777 freighters, and purchase rights for seven additional freighters.

It followed that up with a $3.5 billion deal for 30 of its hot-selling single-aisle 30 737 MAX 8 aircraft with U.S. aircraft leasing firm Jackson Square Aviation, while Qatar Airways finalised an order for five 777 freighters.

Meanwhile, Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for Taiwanese start-up StarLux Airlines to buy 17 of its A350 wide-body planes worth around $6 billion at list prices, and another MoU with an unidentified leasing firm for 80 A320neo single-aisle jets worth about $8.8 billion.

The Farnborough Airshow is the industry’s biggest event this year. It alternates with the Paris Airshow and collectively they account for over a quarter of industry order intake each year.

BREXIT

Opening the event south west of London, British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to reassure aviation bosses that her under-fire Brexit plan won’t disrupt their supply chains.

“We will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. But we will do so in a way that is good for business and good for our future prosperity,” she said.

Businesses have been getting increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity over future trading relations less than nine months before Brexit day on March 29, 2019.

Airbus, which employs around 15,000 people in Britain, warned earlier this month that if Britain left the EU without a deal - a so-called “hard” Brexit - it could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded.

Also at the air show, Britain’s defence minister Gavin Williamson unveiled a model of a new fighter jet called “Tempest” that the country plans to build.

He announced 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) of funding for the project to 2025 and said he was looking for other countries to join, with a senior Royal Air Force official saying Sweden was the most likely partner.

The project faces competition from a rival European one after France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter programme, saying it would start as a bilateral effort with Germany that could be expanded later.

WIDE-BODY WORRIES

On the civilian side, the air show is expected to confirm demand for narrowbody jets from airlines such as Mexico’s VivaAerobus, which is shopping for some 40 Airbuses, and lessors like Goshawk, which ordered 20 A320neo jets on Monday but is also expected to be interested in 737 MAX. Major lessors Air Lease and Avolon are also in town.

But both Airbus and Boeing are under pressure to increase orders for some of their wide-body jets due to a recent slowdown in that part of the market. One exception is the Boeing 787, after a multi-year effort to end delays and cost overruns.

Speaking after the deal for wide-body A350s with StarLux, Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz said he was confident the market for such planes would pick up.

“What I have said consistently is that I see the wide-body market picking up within 18-24 months. I am quite confident.”

“There are explanations as to why this wave is now coming. We had a very massive wave 4-5 years ago with a lot of orders. I think the market had to pause a little bit until we could deliver consistently and get to ramp up and rate. I think this is behind us now.”",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Top Boeing Co (BA.N) and Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) executives on Monday defended their planned commercial aircraft partnership, saying they were confident it would win regulatory and shareholder approvals while launching Embraer into new markets.

“I can’t anticipate that anyone will be against this project given the benefits that this will bring to Brazil,” Embraer’s Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva told a news briefing at Farnborough Airshow. “Who can be against more jobs, more exports, more technology, more access to capital?”

The two aircraft manufacturers announced last month a $4.75 billion joint venture giving Boeing a controlling stake in Embraer’s commercial aircraft arm.

The Boeing-Embraer alliance, following on the heels of the Airbus-Bombardier tie-up announced last year, represents the biggest realignment in the global aerospace market in decades, strengthening established Western planemakers against newcomers from China, Russia and Japan, analysts say.

The new company thrusts Boeing into the lower end of the market, giving stiffer competition to the CSeries jets - now rebranded as the A220 - designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) which are backed by European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA).

The deal must still clear political and regulatory barriers before closing as proposed at the end of next year.

The partnership, which adds a 70- to 130-seat family to Boeing’s lineup, is expected to boost the U.S. firm’s earnings per share from 2020, generating annual pre-tax cost savings of about $150 million by the third year, the companies said.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on Monday the partnership would mark one of the defining moments in Boeing’s long history in aerospace.

In addition to the passenger jet deal, Boeing and Embraer will deepen a sales and services partnership on the new KC-390 military cargo jet through a separate defence venture that is likely to eventually receive a joint investment.

The companies told reporters they would collaborate on next-generations or modifications to the KC-390 platform as well as mutual agreements for managing the supply chain on the military and commercial side, while giving Embraer access to more markets.

The deal will allow the companies to go to customers with combinations of fleet services between the single-aisle 737 MAX airplane and Embraer’s E2 family, the companies said.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Japan’s efforts to show off its new regional jet, the MRJ, were dealt another setback on Tuesday after a prang forced it to skip a flying display at the Farnborough Airshow.

The 90-seat MRJ90, Japan’s first passenger plane since the 1960s, made a successful first demonstration flight on the opening day of the show near London on Monday and was due to fly again on day two.

However, it was damaged by a tow vehicle while being pushed back to its parking place, MRJ said on Tuesday.

“After initial evaluation of our aircraft, we have made the decision not to participate in the flight demonstration today and will focus on our static display,” the company said in a statement.

Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp launched the MRJ project a decade ago, but several delays later it is now only due to enter into service in mid-2020 with launch customer ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T), rather than in 2013 as initially planned.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - British engine-maker Rolls-Royce (RR.L) has provided Boeing (BA.N) with proposals for an engine for the new middle of the market jet being considered by the U.S. planemaker, Rolls-Royce’s chief executive said on Tuesday.

“Boeing have asked us for proposals, we’ve produced some proposals. They’ll continue to refine their requirements and we’ll continue to see if we can address those requirements economically,” Warren East told reporters.

Boeing is studying a gap between narrowbody jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane that could seat 220 to 260 passengers. Currently Rolls-Royce is focussed on supplying engines to wide-body jets.

“As we all know there’s question marks about whether they’re actually going to go ahead or not,” East added.

Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said problems with Rolls’s Trent 1000 engine which had left some Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes grounded would not prevent it from providing the engine for the new plane being mooted.

“I absolutely don’t see it (Trent 1000) as a barrier to success on NMA,” he said, referring to the industry’s term for the new mid-market airplane (NMA).",Reuters,0

The prang, which follows the jet’s debut at the show on Monday, will not interrupt marketing efforts. But it will do nothing to help the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) pull in orders at a time when giants Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) are extending their grip to the smaller end of the market.

The 90-seat MRJ, Japan’s great hope for reviving a dormant commercial aviation industry, was launched a decade ago. Five delays later, it is now expected to enter service with Japanese carrier ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T) in 2020, compared with the initial target of 2013.

As a result, it missed a potentially lucrative window of opportunity to be the first to market with the latest generation of fuel-efficient regional jets.

It is now up against the already in-service Airbus A220 - the newly rebranded former Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) CSeries - and the Embraer E2 series, which may be controlled by Boeing if a provisional deal between the manufacturers is completed.

“These developments are disastrous for the MRJ,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president, analysis at Teal Group. “They are no longer competing with small companies from Canada and Brazil; they are now competing with global aerospace behemoths, with enormous pricing power and industrial scale.”

Mitsubishi Aircraft is looking to gain orders despite the increased competitive threat, and executives at Farnborough, hosting a press conference as the rival A220 flew overhead, said they felt they had a good chance in the regional market.

“This is the newest plane design in several decades,” Shunichi Miyanaga, President and CEO of parent Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T) said. “Engine-wise and aerodynamically it is the newest type of regional jet and is highly competitive.”

It will not compete with the larger variants of the Embraer and A220 planes, with Miyanaga saying that it wanted to focus on the 100-seat and under segment of the market.

U.S. MARKET CHALLENGES

However, analysts say the more immediate challenge is hanging onto its existing order book given Mitsubishi Aircraft has so far lost its bet on U.S. pilot unions relaxing strict rules about the size of jets flown by regional carriers.

Of the 213 firm orders, 150 are split between two U.S. regional carriers, SkyWest Inc (SKYW.O) and Trans States Holdings.

The MRJ90 is too large for them to fly without the relaxation of the pilot union rules and the prospect of changes has dimmed due to a pilot shortage that has given unions more bargaining power.

As a result, Mitsubishi Aircraft is now trying to bring the smaller MRJ70, which can be flown by U.S. regional pilots, into service as quickly as possible, with late 2021 the target date.

FlightGlobal’s 2018 Flight Fleet Forecast released last week estimated the regional jet market as worth $120 billion over the next 20 years, with 40 percent of the value coming from 70-76 seaters serving the North American market.

However, MRJ has yet to convince its key U.S. customers to switch to its smaller jet, which has its own challenges.

The MRJ70 has 69 seats rather than the 76 of the rival Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E175 when configured with business and economy class as is typical in the United States, meaning its fuel efficiency is less of an advantage than it might seem.

“Downsized variants of jetliner families have inferior economics - fewer seats, but the same engines, systems, and most of the structures too,” Teal Group’s Aboulafia said.

Embraer on Monday signed a firm order with United Airlines UAL.N for twenty-five 70-seat E175 jets, shortly after JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) opted to replace its fleet of Embraer jets with the A220.

SkyWest and Trans States did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they plan to switch to the MRJ70.

FINANCIAL DISAPPOINTMENT

For the Japanese consortium behind the MRJ, led by Mitsubishi Heavy with a 64 percent stake, the project has so far been a financial disappointment due to the delays and technical challenges.

Nikkei last week reported Mitsubishi Aircraft was looking to increase its capital through a combination of a debt-to-equity swap and raising fresh equity.

Japan Inc’s ultimate goal for the programme, however, goes beyond profit. It is about serving as a foundation for the revival of Japan as a passenger jet manufacturer, rather than just a major supplier to companies like Boeing.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - European travel and tourism group TUI is likely to plump for the larger variant of the Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX plane when it exercises options on an existing order, a board member said on Tuesday.

“Within our order we already have an amount of MAX 10 and I can see that as being more likely to increase over time,” David Burling, TUI’s CEO of markets and airlines, told Reuters.

TUI has a firm order for 72 737 MAX single-aisle planes with options for another 48. The first 737 MAX 10 is due to be delivered at the end of 2020.

Burling said the MAX 10 provided more seats, meaning it could be used to fly more passengers from constrained airports, where the only way to fly more people is to use bigger planes.

It also has the advantage that, despite being a single-aisle plane, it can fly from Europe to mid-haul destinations such as Egypt and Cape Verde, which are popular winter sun destinations, Burling said.

Tourism-focused airlines such as TUI often struggle to use their single-aisle aircraft fully during the European winter because fewer people holiday, meaning there isn’t demand for the traditional summer destinations.

“We will move through the rollover of the options bit by bit. We won’t order a huge amount in one go,” he said.

Like other airlines, TUI is currently waiting to see what happens to Britain’s negotiations to leave the European Union.

Burling said the group had various plans ready to be implemented, and he was comfortable given the current time frames.

“We are comfortable, given the timescale of events that the British government have indicated, that we will be able to work round any contingency. If the Brexit process goes to a completely different set of timescales I can’t comment,” he said.

For example, TUI can move operations from one of its airline units to another, depending on what licenses are required, he said.

Britain’s easyJet, for example, has set up a new Austria-based airline as a Brexit contingency, but TUI comprises airlines in Britain, Belgium, Germany among others.

Britain and the EU have negotiated a transition deal that would effectively keep Britain as non-voting member of the bloc from Brexit day next March until the end of 2020.

But it has not been ratified yet, meaning the UK could crash out and have to rely on WTO trading terms which, Carney said, would leave the country worse off.

“Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,” Carney told MPs at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England.

Crashing out would prompt the Bank’s monetary policy committee to reassess the economic outlook and interest rates.

“It would be a material event. I wouldn’t prejudge in which direction, though,” Carney said.

“Speaking very narrowly about the financial services side, in the event of a no-deal scenario... there would be big economic consequences. We might have a lot of idle bankers as there is not a lot of demand for their services,” Carney said

Lenders, insurers and asset managers in Britain are playing safe and opening new EU hubs by March to maintain links with customers there irrespective of whether a transition deal of generous future trading terms are secured.

But they worry that without a transition deal, existing cross-border contracts such as derivatives and insurance policies would be disrupted, leaving consumers unable to make claims or companies not covered against adverse moves in currencies or borrowing costs.

Britain has said it will legislate to ensure “continuity” in contracts and that the EU must reciprocate, but the bloc says it was up to banks and not public authorities to get ready.

COLD COMFORT

“Yes, we are concerned that the EU has not yet indicated its solution. The private sector cannot solve these issues,” Carney said.

“This is fundamentally about taking responsibility to protect the financial system... It’s cold comfort, but it will be worse in Europe than it is here.”

Britain’s banks, however, hold enough capital and cash reserves to withstand a disorderly Brexit, Carney said.

Britain last week published its proposals for a future trading agreement with the EU after Brexit, saying it wanted close ties in goods, but with financial services having less access to the bloc than now.

The financial sector attacked the government for not backing the industry’s more ambitious proposals that seek to replicate existing market access.

The industry’s proposals, which the Bank had also backed, were rejected by EU officials in Brussels who say it would mean Britain getting all the benefits of EU membership without the costs and obligations.

Carney said it was too soon to judge what the government’s proposals meant for financial services or for the Bank’s ability to take all decisions necessary to keep the financial system and banks stable.

“It’s premature for us to make a judgement on the White Paper and the outcome of these negotiations. It’s also not clear which activities are going to be in scope,” Carney said.

The White Paper was a “first step” in a hugely important negotiation, he added.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce could start stockpiling parts in months if it looked like Britain was heading towards a disorderly exit from the European Union, the CEO of the UK engine-maker said, expressing frustration with the lack of clarity on the Brexit process.

Britain is due to leave the EU in less than nine months, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading block, creating a headache for companies that rely on the smooth flow of goods and parts across borders.

Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East said the uncertainty meant the company was having to plan for all scenarios, including a disorderly or “no-deal” Brexit, where Britain would crash out of the EU without an agreement on future trading relations.

Asked by reporters at the Farnborough Airshow whether contingency plans meant Rolls-Royce had needed to stockpile parts, East said: “Not yet, but we might have to.”

He said the point that might have to begin was months away, adding: “Probably in Q4 this year.”

While Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday published her blueprint for relations with the EU after Brexit, a so-called White Paper, she first needs to win the support of MPs for the plan, and then win agreement from the EU.

East said the White Paper had been “incrementally positive”, but there were still many unknown factors, and that a vote in the lower house of Parliament on Monday represented a step back.

May won a series of votes in the House of Commons, but only after bowing to pressure from Brexit supporters in her party to make amendments to the plans.

“It was very frustrating that having done a few interviews yesterday and talked about how incrementally positive it (the White Paper) was, at least half of it was undone,” East said.

“We can’t rely on anything,” he added.

Companies with large presences in Britain, such as carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), which makes the wings for all its passenger jets in Britain, have issued warnings about the risk to jobs and investment from Brexit.

Airbus said earlier this month its production could stop in the worst case scenario.

One of the major demands of the aviation industry is that Britain retains access to the European Aviation Safety Agency which issues safety approvals for all parts and planes.

Rolls, one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, laid out contingency plans in April to ensure there was no interruption in engine deliveries by moving the design approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany.

Another part of Rolls’s planning has been to start taking a closer look at its supply chain and in particular the smaller companies, which Rolls’ representatives have been visiting to make sure they are ready to cope with a no-deal Brexit.

“We’ve started to engage in conversations with them (smaller suppliers) and looking at where some of the hotspots might be. We’ve got a bit of a heatmap of levels of risk,” Rolls’s president of civil aerospace Chris Cholerton said.",Reuters,0
"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. regional airline Republic Airways signed a letter of intent to buy 100 E175 passenger jets made by Brazil’s Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA), the two companies said at the Farnborough Airshow on Tuesday.

Republic said the deal would include an option to convert to Embraer’s latest E175-E2 aircraft, with purchase rights for an additional 100 E175 aircraft.

The contract has a value of up to $9.3 billion based at current list prices if all purchase rights are exercised, the airline said.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) sees scope for additional cost savings from suppliers as it expands through the proposed acquisition of the regional jet business of Brazil’s Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA), Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters on Tuesday.

The comment from the head of the world’s largest plane maker is the latest sign of pressure on aerospace suppliers to share the benefits from fast-rising demand for jetliners, highlighted by bullish market forecasts published by Boeing on Tuesday.

Boeing and Airbus have been negotiating price cuts from suppliers as an industry boom leaves an unprecedented eight-year backlog of unfilled orders, and now their efforts to expand outside their traditional market look set to extend that trend.

“The key thing you are going to see is that through the combination between Boeing and Embraer, we will be able to increase volume for our supply chain, which is generally going to be beneficial. And that beneficial volume should also turn into more affordability and competitiveness,” Muilenburg said in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow.

Although a broader tie-up, Boeing’s tentative deal with Embraer echoes Airbus’s (AIR.PA) decision last year to expand into a lower tier by buying Bombardier’s (BBDb.TO) 110- to 130-seat CSeries jet. The Embraer deal is due to close by end-2019.

Asked if he expected further price cuts, beyond those already agreed with suppliers, Muilenburg said: “Yes. Because you’ll see additional increases in volume. And a very typical discussion we’ll have with our supply chain is, if there’s an opportunity for them to increase volume or access to additional platforms, if we can gain a cost advantage in the marketplace, that’s a mutual benefit.”

Boeing, meanwhile, continues to “keep a very close eye” on consolidation among its major suppliers and will continue to expand where necessary, he said.

Analysts say the effective creation of a two-tier duopoly, with Boeing and Airbus both expanding into smaller jets, could push more suppliers to merge to maintain negotiating power.

“In some cases, consolidation can be beneficial where it allows the supply chain to take costs out. If we get to a point where consolidation is reducing our sources to a level where we can’t stand, we’ve had the opportunity to build new sources of supply. We always have that flexibility,” Muilenburg said.

Muilenburg suggested Boeing would continue to push into areas traditionally dominated by suppliers, bringing some areas of production in-house in a process dubbed vertical integration.

Some aerospace suppliers have been rattled by Boeing’s recent moves to integrate parts. In the most recent example, it set up a joint venture with France’s Safran SA (SAF.PA) to break into the highly concentrated market for auxiliary power units.

“We are very targeted in that area,” Muilenburg said, when asked where he would set the limits for such expansion.

Boeing has 30-40 categories or “verticals” across its platforms and when deciding where to invest, it considers whether there is a good services business attached, he said.

Muilenburg said Boeing would offer services to airlines operating not only Boeing jets but Airbus jets, mirroring remarks by its European arch-rival that it was prepared to provide data services on Boeing planes. Both companies are building up services that benefit from a wide pool of data.

RESILIENT DEMAND

Boeing earlier unveiled a higher 20-year demand forecast for passenger jets driven by an expanding middle class.

Muilenburg, who said on Sunday he was concerned about recent protectionist trade rhetoric, said there was no reason to soften the forecast.

“Those trends that we’ve talked about are proving to be sustainable even when there’s tough trade rhetoric around the world, when there are geopolitical issues that are being addressed and brought to the surface,” Muilenburg said.

Boeing became embroiled in a trade spat last year when it claimed Canadian planemaker Bombardier had billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies, only to find itself getting drawn into a row with the UK over Bombardier jobs.

Muilenburg said relations remained sound with Britain, where Boeing had doubled investments.

He confirmed Boeing was holding discussions over replacing its six British E-3D Sentry airborne early warning planes with Boeing E-7 Wedgetail jets.

“It’s a lesson,” he said, referring to the Bombardier matter and the ripple effect regional geopolitical spats can have on a global business in a world “becoming more and more networked”.

But he said Boeing would do “exactly the same” if given the chance to rethink the trade claim, which was overturned by a U.S. tribunal, adding it had acted against unfair practices.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N) raised its rolling 20-year industry forecast for passenger and cargo aircraft on Tuesday, as a steady flow of deals on day two of the Farnborough Airshow underscored the industry’s resilience to rising global trade tensions.

The world’s biggest planemaker predicted 42,700 industry deliveries over the next two decades, up three percent from its estimate of 41,030 a year ago. That would be worth $6.3 trillion (4.78 trillion pounds) at list prices versus last year’s $6.1 trillion forecast.

The U.S. group and European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) continued to rack up deals at the air show in southern England after a brisk opening day on Monday.

Russian airline Volga Dnepr committed to buying Boeing freighters worth $11.8 billion at list prices, while U.S. leasing company Air Lease Corp committed to buying as many as 78 Boeing aircraft worth $9.6 billion.

In the meantime, Airbus bagged a provisional deal with an unidentified customer for 100 single-aisle A320 family jets, worth about $11.5 billion at list prices.

But analysts cautioned many deals firmed up provisional ones, disclosed previously unidentified buyers, or changed existing orders, making it hard to gauge the level of demand.

Rising oil prices and interest rates, trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain’s departure from the European Union all pose a risk to an eight-year boom in civil aviation, which has boosted industry order books and share prices.

Boeing’s forecasts underscored the sector’s reliance on emerging markets in general and China in particular, making the U.S. planemaker especially vulnerable should trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate into a full trade war.

Boeing, which calls itself America’s biggest exporter, delivered more than one out of every four jetliners it made last year to customers in China, one of the world’s fast-growing aircraft markets.

Boeing’s vice-president of commercial marketing Randy Tinseth told a news briefing that China looked set to overtake the United States as the world’s biggest domestic air travel market in 10-15 years.

But he declined to be drawn into commenting on U.S. trade policy, saying: “We are going to focus on what we can control.”

INTENSIFYING COMPETITION

Dominating Boeing’s upbeat outlook was a five percent increase in the forecast for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families, underpinned by an unchanged prediction for average global traffic growth of 4.7 percent.

The Chicago-based planemaker now sees 31,360 deliveries in the medium-haul, single-aisle category, the cash cow of the world’s top two planemakers and popular with low-cost airlines. Two weeks ago, Airbus (AIR.PA) raised its own rolling forecast for industry deliveries by more than seven percent and revamped the way it predicts demand, introducing new plane categories from ‘Small’ to ‘Extra-Large’ and blurring the traditional boundaries between aircraft types. Boeing’s Tinseth said Airbus sought to show it was winning a sizable share of the aircraft market. “Let me make one thing clear,” Tinseth said. “By every measure, in every way, our wide-bodies are winning. Period.” Even so, Boeing lowered its wide-body delivery forecast by 140 aircraft to 8,070, saying higher deliveries over the last year and longer-range single-aisle planes ate into the rolling forecast. Boeing saw a small increase in demand in the cargo market, a barometer of trade and business confidence, forecasting 980 new freighters from a projected 920 a year ago, fuelled by the growth of e-commerce, particularly in China. The planemaker unveiled a volley of freight orders in the first two days of the Farnborough show.

Boeing’s overall forecast tally is a bigger number partly because it counts aircraft with 90 seats or more, whereas Airbus starts at 100 seats. The smaller-end of the aircraft market has seen its biggest shake-up in decades after Airbus closed a deal to buy Bombardier’s (BBDb.TO) 110-130-seat CSeries jet, mirrored last week by Boeing’s tentative deal to acquire the commercial unit of Brazil’s Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA). Boeing shaved its forecast for the regional jet fleet to 2,320 deliveries. Analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to use their scale to heap pressure on suppliers to lower costs, which could trigger consolidation.

"Business aviation services company Comlux is making its first foray into the commercial aircraft market with the launch of a division dedicated to promoting and installing its auxiliary fuel tank offering, known as the forward additional Comlux tank (FACT).

Speaking to FlightGlobal at the show, where Comlux is promoting the system, chief operating officer Arnaud Martin, said the move is designed to broaden the company's portfolio of services beyond the ""volatile, but rewarding"" business aviation market, to the ""more stable"" commercial airliner sector.

The first FACT has been designed and built for Airbus A321s equipped with the airframer's auxiliary fuel tank system. ""There are around 500 examples of these 170-180-seaters, and we hope to get around 10% of this market,"" says Martin.

The FACT was developed by the company's Indianapolis-based completions and maintenance, repair and overhaul subsidiary, Comlux USA, with Airbus ""playing an advisory role"", says Martin.

The system achieved US supplemental type certification in February after a four-month flight-test campaign, with a privately owned VIP A321 providing the testbed.

The VIP variants will only make up a small share of the FACT market, Martin says, as there are so few of the types in service. ""The commercial airliner market on the other hand has huge potential from operators looking to increase the value of their ceo [current engine option] variants and to offer longer routes on their network,"" he adds. The FACT boosts the A321 variant's range by up to 400nm (740km) to 3,600nm.

""We may widen the offering eventually to include A321s that don’t have the additional Airbus fuel tanks, but we will have to address centre of gravity issues to make this happen,"" he adds.

Comlux plans to offer a FACT family covering a variety of airliners, including the A320 and Boeing 757. ""It has huge potential on other platforms, but our focus for now is on the A321,"" says Martin.

"Blending dents and dings on a compressor blade from outside an engine using a remotely-operated tool via a bore hole is a highly cost-effective way to carry out maintenance.

The engine can continue to operate, perhaps with minor compressor efficiency degradation, and does not need to be taken off wing for an unscheduled overhaul shop visit.

Rolls-Royce says, however, that only a limited number of specialist engineers are qualified to carry out bore-blending tasks – and they are not always immediately available when required.

In order to employ such experts more efficiently, the UK manufacturer has developed a robot that can be fitted to an engine by regular technicians and then remotely operated, via data link, by a specialist elsewhere.

The equipment, developed in partnership with the University of Nottingham, is at technology readiness level five and has been tested on full-scale engines.

R-R on-wing technology specialist James Kell said during a briefing at Farnborough air show on 17 July that the robot should enter production within a year or two.

The project is part of a wider effort to develop inspection and maintenance robots, although the devices are currently at different maturity levels.

In one of these projects, R-R is evaluating installing a network of permanent cameras throughout the engine, to spot and report potential maintenance requirements. Noting that the cameras would need to be protected against extreme heat to withstand conditions inside the core, Kell says t he pencil-sized devices would extend into the gas path like periscopes, to supply visual information alongside other sensors in the engine.

A project dubbed FLARE, currently at technology readiness level 3, comprises a robot pair that can be inserted like endoscopes into the core via boreholes, in order to undertake thermal barrier coating patch repairs.

Kell says that one of the two snake-like devices will inspect the damaged area and remove the existing surface, while the other re-applies a temporary patch coating that would allow the aircraft to fly until a permanent repair can be made.

Under a project named SWARM that is being undertaken with Harvard University, R-R is studying the use of a flock of “collaborative” miniature robots with cameras, which autonomously crawl around engines to inspect hard-to-reach areas.

The multi-legged devices were inspired by cockroaches, says Harvard research fellow Sébastien de Rivaz, and are inserted – as a group – into the engine by a snake-like device similar to that in the FLARE project. Still at a conceptual stage (TRL2), the team is testing robots with a length of 4.5cm (1.8in) that weigh about 1.5g. The completed robots are projected to have a diameter of around 1cm, R-R says.

De Rivaz says the project is still four to five years away from being tested on an engine. But the concept promises to deliver significant savings in terms of time and money. Kell thinks it is feasible that inspections, which take five hours with a conventional borescope, could be completed in five minutes.

"Airbus chief executive Tom Enders is braced for an intense half-year as the airframer aims to catch up on its single-aisle delivery backlog, and clearing the parked fleet of engineless A320neos.

The airframer would need to deliver over 53 A320-family aircraft each month over the second half just to equal last year’s output, discounting any higher targets.

“We’ve been backloaded before, everybody knows that,” Enders told investors during the Farnborough air show. “But here we’re backloaded for the entire second half of the year.”

During June the company handed over 67 single-aisle jets which, he says, was the third-best month in its history for A320-family deliveries.

"Putting the Airbus A350-1000 through its paces during this week’s flying display is a ­Farnborough veteran making his last appearance before retiring this summer.

Peter Chandler, who is Airbus’s senior experimental test pilot and in recent years chief test pilot, retires in August after a stellar flying career that began in the Royal Air Force four decades ago and has encompassed test-flying aeronautical hardware ranging from the Goodyear blimp and Lockheed C-5 Galaxy to Vought A-7 Corsair and Airbus A380.

During his career, Chandler has accumulated over 13,200 flying hours and made many Farnborough demonstrations. Notable appearances include showing off the Panavia Tornado GR1 in 1986 as the RAF’s solo display pilot to leading a Red Arrows “Vic formation” across the airfield 20 years later in the A380.

Chandler’s love of aviation began during his school days, when he ­managed to get some back-seat time in de Havilland Canada Chipmunks with the RAF cadets. He went on to study aeronautical engineering at Southampton University with a view to going into the engineering and design side of the aerospace industry.

BillyPix

He continued to pursue his love of flying through membership of the University Air Squadron (UAS) at Hamble airfield where he says he probably “spent far too much time flying Chipmunks and not enough time studying!”.

He recalls: “When I was in the UAS ­I did reasonably well at flying and was encouraged to apply to the Air Force. So I went straight from graduating to RAF Cranwell.”

And so began an almost 20-year ­career flying fast jets, starting with training on the Hunting Jet Provost and Folland Gnat (at RAF Valley), followed by the Hawker Hunter.

“I then went to RAF Honington to fly the Buccaneer in 1977,” he says. After completing the operational conversion unit course, Chandler spent four years on 12 Sqn, mainly at Honington and latterly at RAF Lossiemouth.

“I then got picked up for the Tornado GR1 and was on the first conversion course to form the first Tornado squadron, which was then 9 Sqn,” says Chandler. “So I was back at Honington again for the next several years.”

While flying the Tornado, Chandler became an instructor on the weapons conversion unit and was selected to be the solo display pilot during the 1986 season. This was when he began a lasting association with Farnborough which had a memorable first appearance.

Tricky manoeuvres

“Doing my Tornado displays around the country, my authorisation was ‘not below 100ft’ and there wasn’t really a speed limit apart from ‘don’t drop a boom’. So we’d aim to get as close to 600kt as we could on the last run then pull up in a vertical climb to 15,000-20,000ft.”

Chandler says that height constraints around the Farnborough boundaries made the manoeuvring more difficult “but we managed to get it down close to 100ft and going jolly fast”.

After his first Farnborough display, Chandler was summoned by the Grp Capt who headed the flying display committee for what he thought would be a telling off.

“The Grp Capt told me that I’d not actually done anything wrong, but I’d scared the wits out of his secretary, who had been sitting in the tower close to the display line, so would I please go and apologise to her!”

After completing the 1986 display season Chandler joined the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment at RAF Cottesmore for a two-year tour where he headed the UK training squadron.

“I then declined an offer of a career in the air force involving lots of ground tours, and applied to do the test-pilot school,” he says.

Chandler did a year at Edwards Air Force Base in California, attending the US Air Force Test Pilot School in 1989, where he primarily flew the McDonnell Douglas F-4, the Northrop T-38 and the A-7.

“Almost every week we had a guest aeroplane – everything from F-15s and F-18s to C-5s and even the Goodyear blimp, which was quite an eye-­opener,” he says. “I remember being told when you’re taxiing the C-5, look at the ground speed read because otherwise you’ll end up doing 40kt and you won’t think you’re even moving.”

This advice would prove useful in his future career testing the A380.

Five years followed at the UK Empire Test Pilot’s School at Boscombe Down where Chandler flew a variety of types. His time there included three years as an instructor and latterly as the principal tutor on the fixed-wing course.

Civvy street beckoned in 1994 when Chandler joined Virgin Atlantic and spent the next six years flying the airline’s Airbus A340s, during which time he participated in project work with Airbus. This saw Chandler start spending time in Toulouse, initially working with Airbus on navigation and communications systems and later on the development of the A340-600, for which Virgin was launch customer.

Airbus beckons

In 2000 Chandler accepted a job offer to join Airbus’s flight-test team, a move that would ultimately lead to a five-year stint as its chief test pilot.

“Within a few months of arriving I was deputy project pilot for the A380, working with Jacques Rosay, who was chief pilot and a fantastic guy to work with,” says Chandler. Sadly Rosay passed away three years ago after a battle with cancer.

“Between the two of us – with help from a lot of others – we pretty much carried out the whole revamp of the [Airbus] cockpit, which ended up being the A380 cockpit,” he says.

Chandler undertook much of the A380 flight-test programme and as that work concluded he got stuck into the design of the A350 cockpit.

When Rosay became ill, Chandler replaced him as chief test pilot and was the third Brit to hold the post after Nick Warner and Bill Wainwright. This saw him lead the flight-test programme for the A350, culminating in him commanding its first flight on 14 June 2013.

“This was a real highlight of my Airbus career – every test pilot’s dream is to do a first flight of a new prototype. And on the third flight a week later, we got clearance to a flyby at the Paris air show,” he recalls.

After a lengthy career in flight-test management, Chandler stood down as chief test pilot in December 2015 as he wanted “to slow down a bit before retirement”. He has spent the last two and a half years as senior experimental test pilot and has continued to be very much involved in Airbus flight-testing and design work. Looking back, Chandler says it is the latter part of his career that has provided the most satisfaction.

After his August retirement, Chandler and his wife Kate plan to spend their time living in France and the UK as well as travelling and enjoying their boat on the Canal Du Midi. Flying, he says, may still be on his agenda “but not until I get bored with all of that!”.

Happy retirement, Peter!

"All Nippon Airways will cancel 378 domestic flights operated by Boeing 787s during August to accommodate mandatory inspections on their Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.

The planned cancellations are down significantly from the 619 reported during July, which were triggered by a Japan Civil Aviation Bureau move to extend the scope of inspections on ‘Package C’ Trent 1000s to include ‘Package B’ engines.

ANA adds that it owns 66 Package C and 70 Package B Trent 1000 engines. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that the engines power its fleet of 36 787-8s and 28 787-9s.

“Safety is always our top priority for our customers, and we consider these cancellations unavoidable to maintain our highest safety standard,” says the Star Alliance carrier.

The inspections have been triggered by durability issues with intermediate compressor blades in both variants of the Trent 1000 engine. Those have been cited in recent investigations into engine failure incidents on 787s operated by Air New Zealand and Scoot.

A number of other Trent 1000 operators have also been affected by the increased inspection cycle on the engines, with Virgin Atlantic, LATAM Airlines, and Air New Zealand leasing in other aircraft to cover downtime on their 787 fleets.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus is aiming to have secured orders for at least 500 aircraft by the end of the Farnborough air show.

Chief executive Tom Enders, speaking to investors during the show, said that chief commercial officer Eric Schulz had “already sold” over 400 aircraft at the event.

He adds that there would “most probably be a ‘five’” ahead of the figure by the end of the show, indicating a total of more than 500 jets.

Enders also suggested that the event would be “very good” for Airbus, compared with previous recent Farnborough shows in 2016 and 2014.

Airbus has revealed several orders and commitments during the last few days – both in the long-haul and single-aisle sectors – although several have been attributed to unidentified customers.

The airframer had accumulated gross orders for 177 single-aisle and 84 long-haul aircraft over the first six months of this year.

Schulz admits that agreements for 40 single-aisle and 12 widebody aircraft unveiled at the show were already part of this first-half total, but he says that, up to the morning of 18 July, Airbus has announced additional deals for 339 single-aisle and 31 long-haul aircraft.

These potentially take gross orders to 631 and Schulz says he is confident of reaching more than 750 by the end of the show.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nothing is certain about a reported AirAsia (AIRA.KL) order for Airbus (AIR.PA) A321neo jets until it is announced, and everything is still possible, AirAsia’s chairman said when asked about the possible deal.

Industry sources have said AirAsia is discussing the possible purchase of another 100 Airbus A321neo jets as the airline and Airbus go down to the wire in parallel negotiations for an expanded order for larger A330neo jets.

Asked about the deal, AirAsia Chairman Kamarudin Meranun told Reuters at the Skytrax World Airline awards in London: “Everything is a potential. Nothing is cemented as yet.”

“Everything is a possibility until the day we announce it,” he said, declining further comment as he said it was a commercially sensitive issue for the listed company.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is not planning to respond with a new aircraft should U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) go ahead with a proposed middle of the market jet, the European aerospace group’s chief executive said on Wednesday.

“We have no problem with the middle of the market because we are there,” Tom Enders told journalists at the Farnborough Airshow, saying Airbus could further improve its existing aircraft, such as the A321neo.

Reuters has reported that Airbus is looking at an extended-range version of the A321neo.

Enders was speaking after British budget carrier easyJet (EZJ.L) took its first A321neo to the airshow.

EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said, however, that the airline would not be interested in an XLR (extended range) version because it doesn’t fit with easyJet’s business model.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - British low cost airline easyJet (EZJ.L) raised its profit guidance, forecasting earnings could soar by as much as 45 percent this year as it benefits from the collapse of rivals last year and strikes at competitor Air France (AIRF.PA).

The company, Europe’s second-largest budget airline behind Ryanair (RYA.I), also said it was set to get a boost from new, larger planes which would be more cost effective and help it to grow at popular airports that are already close to full.

At the Farnborough Airshow in southern England, CEO Johan Lundgren hosted British transport minister Chris Grayling on a flight on the airline’s first Airbus (AIR.PA) A321neo jet.

The 235-seat plane, with sleek grey leather seats, has quieter, more fuel-efficient engines and is the airline’s largest aircraft so far, 30 percent bigger than the A320 jets it also flies.

“This is a fantastic way we can provide growth to make sure we meet the demand that we have,” Lundgren, who became CEO in December, told reporters on Wednesday.

EasyJet is set to receive 30 of the planes, which it will fly on popular routes between London Gatwick and tourist destinations in Spain, such as Palma and Malaga.

PROFIT SOARS

The airline predicted pretax profit for the 12 months to the end of September in a range of 550-590 million pounds, up from an estimate of 530-580 million in May.

It called the competitive environment benign, saying it was continuing to benefit from the failure of smaller British rival Monarch last year and that it had picked up passengers from Air France, which has cancelled flights due to strikes.

EasyJet also said strong demand for holidays had helped to offset the cost of a jump in flight cancellations during its fiscal third quarter.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Air traffic control restrictions, industrial action, and severe weather meant easyJet cancelled 2,606 flights in the quarter, up from 314 in the same period last year.

Costs from the disruption were 25 million pounds higher than in the same quarter a year earlier, the airline said.

Despite the problems, easyJet said there had been strong demand across its markets.

“It’s a situation where we’re doing well in terms of all the market,” Lundgren said.

The company also said it was seeing strong growth in sales of products outside of tickets, such as passengers paying to check-in bags and choose their seats on the plane. It said an improved website had helped boost these revenues.

At 1300 GMT, easyJet shares were up 0.6 percent, having earlier climbed as much as 4 percent.

BREXIT

Britain is due to leave the European Union in less than nine months, but Lundgren said he was confident easyJet could keep flying whatever sort of deal the UK strikes with the bloc.

“I’m still very convinced there will not be any disruption of flying post Brexit. Even the (European) Commission has said that in case of hard Brexit, they will implement a bare-bones agreement that will ensure continued connectivity,” he said.

When asked about the UK government’s blueprint for Britain’s future relationship with the EU which it laid out in a so-called White Paper last Thursday, Lundgren said it was a step in the right direction.

“The White Paper is a good step because it’s a liberal deal on aviation, based on what it is today. Now we (the UK) need to start engaging with European counterparts,” he said onboard the A321 flight between Gatwick and the Farnborough Airshow.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is activating its Brexit contingency plans as the British government’s strategy for leaving the European Union appears to be “unravelling,” the head of Europe’s biggest planemaker said on Wednesday.

Britain is due to leave the EU in less than nine months, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc, creating a headache for companies that rely on the smooth flow of goods and parts across borders.

Airbus, which employs 15,000 people in Britain, has issued a series of warnings about the dangers of the country quitting the EU without an agreed deal, saying this month that could halt output at its plants and leave aircraft grounded.

CEO Tom Enders said at the Farnborough Airshow that the so-called White Paper published by the UK government last Thursday which laid out its post-Brexit plans for trade with the EU was positive, but that events since had changed that view.

“I thought that the White Paper was going in the right direction,” Enders told reporters.

“Now we see that unravelling again so all the more reason for us to take more serious decisions,” he said, referring to the Conservative government’s move to accept amendments to its plan from a group of hardline Brexit supporters in its party.

Airbus will now activate contingency plans to ensure its production can continue whatever the trading relationship after Brexit, Enders said, adding the main focus was on stockpiling parts that currently arrive at factories on a “just in time” basis.

“We are now activating contingency plans which largely focus on building some buffers ... so we should be able for a short period after the exit happens to mitigate the effects,” he said.

British engine-maker Rolls-Royce (RR.L) said on Tuesday it too could start stockpiling parts, but would not do that until around the fourth quarter of this year.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - James Bond would love it. Aston Martin, maker of the luxury sports cars favored by the fictional British spy, has now come up with a futuristic personal aircraft it has dubbed “a sports car for the skies”.

Aston Martin unveiled the three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle this week at the Farnborough Airshow and, though the concept remains for now the stuff of science fiction, believes it could help one day to revolutionize travel.

The Volante Vision Concept design has vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities and will be able to hit speeds of around 200 miles per hour (322 kph), “so you can go from the center of Birmingham to the center of London in about 30 minutes,” Aston Martin’s Simon Sproule told Reuters.

Aviation and technology leaders are working to make electric-powered flying taxis a reality, including Airbus, U.S. ride-sharing firm Uber and a range of start-ups including one backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, called Kitty Hawk.

Aston Martin believes it could corner the market for luxury flying vehicles in the future.

“The same way that you have Uber and you have an Aston Martin, you’ll have ‘Uber in the skies’ and you’ll have ‘Aston Martin in the skies’,” said Sproule, adding that such an aircraft won’t come cheap.

“This is clearly a luxury object - it’s a sports car for the skies - so pricing is going to be commensurate with that, so certainly into the seven figures.”

“FEELS LIKE A FIGHTER JET”

The company has partnered with Cranfield University, Cranfield Aerospace Solutions and British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce to develop the concept vehicle, including artificial intelligence-powered autonomous capabilities.

“It feels like a fighter jet but at the same time it has the Aston Martin luxury,” said David Debney, chief of future aircraft concepts at Rolls-Royce.

Commenting on how to pilot the vehicle, Cranfield’s Helen Atkinson said: “You’ve got to detect what’s going on in the external environment and then turn that around incredibly quickly in the computer system with the artificial intelligence built in to actually achieve the necessary level of autonomy.”

Separately at Farnborough, Rolls-Royce unveiled plans for a flying taxi - an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) vehicle which could carry four to five people at speeds of up to 250 miles (400 km) per hour for approximately 500 miles.

The company said it was starting a search for partners to help develop a project it hopes could take to the skies as soon as early next decade.

The plan is part of efforts by Rolls to carry out as much maintenance as possible while the engine is on the wing of a plane.

Removing engines from wings incurs disruption for airlines, and so doing more maintenance while the engines are in place saves time and money for airlines, and also reduces costs for Rolls-Royce as the maintenance provider.

In one early-stage technology, Rolls-Royce is looking at using a snake-style robot to deposit a set of miniature robots into the center of an engine to carry out a visual inspection.

The mini robots resemble small scuttling beetles, and are inspired by cockroaches. James Kell, on-wing technology specialist at Rolls, said they could help get the time taken to carry out a visual inspection of hard to reach areas down from hours to minutes.

“There’s lots of things that aren’t ready yet, there’s more work to do yet to get this more mature,” Kell said, such as working out how to safely get the robots out of the engine again.

In another technology, Rolls has developed a boreblending robot that can be remotely controlled, for complicated maintenance tasks that typically require specialists.

Instead of sending a specialist engineer to the wing, the machine can be fitted to the engine by a local team. A Rolls specialist engineer at its base in Derby would then take control of the robot remotely and direct it.

“The aim is to service engines within hours rather than days,” Kell said.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The United States has offered India the armed version of Guardian drones that were originally authorized for sale as unarmed for surveillance purposes, a senior U.S. official and an industry source told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone sits in a hanger at Creech Air Force Base May 19, 2016. REUTERS/Josh Smith/File Photo

If the deal comes to fruition, it would be the first time Washington has sold a large armed drone to a country outside the NATO alliance.

It would also be the first high-tech unmanned aircraft in the region, where tensions between India and Pakistan run high.

In April, President Donald Trump’s administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defence industry and create jobs at home.

The plan included a new drone export policy that allowed lethal drones that can fire missiles, and surveillance drones of all sizes, to be more widely available to allies.

One administrative hurdle to the deal is that Washington is requiring India to sign up to a communications framework that some in New Delhi worry might be too intrusive, the U.S. official said.

The drones were on the agenda at a cancelled meeting between Indian and the U.S. ministers of state and defence that was set for July, the sources said. The top level meeting is now expected to take place in September.

Last June, General Atomics said the U.S. government had approved the sale of a naval variant of the drone. India has been in talks to buy 22 of the unarmed surveillance aircraft, MQ-9B Guardian, worth more than $2 billion to keep watch over the Indian Ocean.

Besides potentially including the armed version of the drone, the sources said the number of aircraft had also changed.

An Indian defence source said the military wanted a drone not just for surveillance but also to be able to hunt down targets at land and sea. The military had argued the costs of acquisition did not justify buying an unarmed drone.

The cost and integration of the weapons system are still issues, as well as Indian assent to the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) which Washington insists on as a condition for operating advanced defence systems.

India, the defence source said, has shed its opposition to the agreement after an assurance from the United States it would apply largely to U.S-procured weapons systems such as fighter planes and drones and not to the large Russian-origin equipment with the Indian military.

U.S. drone manufacturers, facing growing competition overseas, especially from Chinese and Israeli rivals which often sell under lighter restrictions, have lobbied hard for the changes in U.S export rules.

Among the changes will be a more lenient application by the U.S. government of an arms export principle known as “presumption of denial.” This has impeded many drone deals by automatically denying approval unless a compelling security reason is given together with strict buyer agreements to use the weapons in accordance with international law.

A second U.S. official said the new policy would “change our calculus” by easing those restrictions on whether to allow any given sale.

The MTCR – a 1987 missile-control pact signed by the United States and 34 other countries – will still require strict export controls on Predator-type drones, which it classifies as Category 1, those with a payload of over 1,100 pounds (500 kg).

However, the Trump administration is seeking to renegotiate the MTCR accord to eventually make it easier to export the larger armed drones.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) is in talks with Airbus (AIR.PA) and other companies about joining its bid for a 4 billion euro ($4.7 billion) heavy-lift helicopter contract in Germany, the head of business development for Boeing’s defence unit said on Wednesday.

Gene Cunningham told Reuters that Boeing was continuing to fine-tune its approach for the German competition, which pits Boeing’s CH-47 Chinook against the new CH-53K Sikorsky King Stallion built by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N).

The German defence ministry expects to start the competition later this year or early next, with the target of awarding a contract in mid-2020 for deliveries to start in 2023.

“We are still in talks with other companies, Airbus included, and we continue to strengthen the team that we’ve put in place,” Cunningham said in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow outside London.

He said those discussions would continue as the proposal process unfolded, and Boeing evaluated Germany’s needs for the new helicopters and subsequent servicing.

Boeing has already teamed up with 10 German firms to bid for the contract, squaring off with the biggest U.S. arms maker, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), which has also announced agreements with Germany’s Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE) and other firms.

Cunningham said the CH-47 was well positioned to win the contract given its performance, cost and the fact it is already in use by a number of Germany’s NATO allies, including the Netherlands, Britain, Spain, Canada and Italy.

The CH-53K is a new aircraft developed for the U.S. Marine Corps that is due to be declared operational in 2019. The new helicopters will replace the existing CH-53G fleet that has been flying for over 45 years.

Buying the Chinook would strengthen cooperation among German and its NATO partners, while providing assurance that the products and capabilities would be readily available to be available, Cunningham said.

He said he did not expect changes at the helm of the German air force and arms procurement arm to affect the competition. “I don’t envision a significant change,” he said.

Barry McCullough, who leads business development at Lockheed’s rotary and missions systems business, said cost would clearly play a role, and that his company was working hard to reduce the cost of the new CH-53K aircraft.

He said a plan was in place to trim overall programme costs by $800 million, which would drive down unit costs for possible foreign military sales to Germany and Israel.

The government of long-ruling President Yoweri Museveni has said restarting the national carrier will help Uganda take a slice of the region’s growing aviation business and also invigorate the service sector of the economy.

Kenya Airways (KQNA.NR), South Africa Airways and Ethiopian Airlines currently dominate the country’s air travel business.

In a statement on the memorandum of understanding signed at the Farnborough airshow in the UK, Airbus said Uganda would purchase two A330-800neo aircrafts.

An iteration of Airbus’ A330 widebody airliner, the A330-800neo features new wings and Rolls-Royce’s new generation Trent 7000 engines.

Airbus’ chief commercial officer, Eric Schulz said in the statement that the planes would “bring a range of benefits offering unrivalled efficiencies with the most modern cabin. We look forward to see the A330-800neo flying in the colors of Uganda.”

Founded by Uganda’s former dictator Idi Amin in 1976, Uganda Airlines was liquidated in the 1990s by Museveni’s government under a broader program to privatize troubled state firms and open up the economy to private enterprise.

The country is keen to expand its aviation industry, especially as it prepares to start pumping crude oil from fields in its west, a development expected drive up business traveler arrivals.

A new international airport, financed partly with UK credit, is being built near the fields, primarily to service the oil industry.

Once completed it will be the country’s second international airport after Entebbe, south of the capital Kampala, which is also being expanded with a loan from China to handle more passengers and cargo.

“This agreement demonstrates our ambition for economic growth supported by a robust aviation industry,” Ephraim Bagenda, chief executive officer of Uganda Airlines said in the statement.",Reuters,0

Not so this week, when Airbus and Boeing announced almost 300 orders from unnamed buyers, reversing the PR rulebook.

Airbus led the anonymous jetliner haul with almost 200 orders worth $24 billion at list prices, while Boeing said it had signed provisional deals with four unnamed customers for a total of 94 planes worth almost $11 billion at catalog prices.

Airbus declined to discuss the identity of the buyers, but industry sources said its list was dominated by Chinese-related leasing companies.

Chief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz linked the reticence to global trade tensions, telling analysts some Asian customers had asked Airbus not to fan growing disputes. “Undisclosed or disclosed, either way the order is there,” he said.

“If that is enough to make airline customers want anonymity, what might they do if the trade disputes were to escalate?,” Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris commented in a note.

Several top delegates cautioned against overstating the link with trade tensions, however. Numerous factors are at play when deciding when to reveal order plans, such as waiting for board or government approvals, they said.

Winning the air show competition also has something to do with the sequence of announcements, two industry sources said. Airbus is behind Boeing in the race for orders this year.

AIRASIA SUSPENSE

Airbus listed orders for 80 A320neo narrowbody jets from an unidentified leasing company, another for 100 similar narrowbody aircraft, plus 14 large jets - eight A350-900 and six A330neo.

On Tuesday, Reuters reported that the first order for 80 aircraft came from China’s ICBC Leasing.

Several industry sources said the largest order for 100 jets had been placed by Dublin-based global leasing giant Avolon, owned by China’s HNA Group.

An Avolon spokesman said: “We are in constant dialogue with (manufacturers) and when we have an order to announce we will do that.”

Airbus is currently tackling payment delays from HNA Group which led to a backlog of undelivered wide-body A330 jets, first reported by Reuters last week.

One has been delivered and others are expected to follow.

Avolon is owned by HNA vehicle Bohai Leasing and made changes in its bond structure earlier this year to insulate itself from the parent group’s financial difficulties.

Avolon CEO Domhnal Slattery told Reuters this week those measures were working smoothly, but did not discuss order plans.

Planemakers often strike deals during the rest of the year with customers shy about disclosing their identity, especially in countries like China with complex approval processes.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Israeli military electronics firm Elbit Systems, which has just completed two acquisitions in the United States and Israel, remains on the lookout for potential takeover targets in the United States and Europe, a top official said Wednesday.

Ran Kril, executive vice president for international marketing and business development, told Reuters the company was looking to increase its presence in several countries to benefit from growing demand for a wide range of military equipment.

“M&A has been and will be part of our strategy as we are trying to strengthen our presence in the U.S., U.K. and Europe,” Kril said in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow.

Elbit, which makes drones, pilot helmet displays and cyber security systems, last week unveiled a 1.6 tonne unmanned vehicle designed to fly in airspace currently reserved for piloted civilian planes.

Kril said the planned acquisition of state-owned IMI Systems from the Israeli government for up to $522 million would help Elbit offer far more comprehensive solutions to its customers.

Completion of the deal, which must still be approved by the Israel Antitrust Authority, would likely see Elbit pass Israel Aerospace Industries as the country’s biggest defense contractor. The company completed the purchase of U.S.-based Universal Avionics Systems for $120 million in April.

Kril said he saw a big increase in European demand for military and security systems fueled by security concerns linked to the Russian annexation of Crimea, increased immigration, and as a result of long-neglected modernization needs.

“After many years, for defense industries, Europe has woken up. We see a dramatic change in budgets and demand, and in the willingness to promote security and defense,” he said.

One key growth area will be in the area of protecting aircraft against strikes by shoulder-fired air-to-surface missiles, said Arnon Bram, who heads the Elbit unit that makes such Direct Infrared Counter Measures (DIRCM) systems.

Bram said 135 such systems had been sold or ordered by 19 customers in 15 countries, including Germany for its A400M military transport planes.

The company expected to more than double that number in coming years, given growing demand from foreign militaries and for the transport of heads of state, Bram said.",Reuters,0

"UK engineering firm Derwent Aviation Consulting has developed a new engine architecture that promises to halve nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and generate part of its thrust through electrical power.

The company, led by Charles Cuddington – Rolls-Royce's former chief commercial officer for large engines – has devised a concept under which a turbofan's low-pressure compressor, or booster, is driven by both the low- and high-pressure turbines, rather than just the LPT in a conventional two-spool layout.

This is to be facilitated by a planetary gearbox linking the engine's low-pressure and high-pressure shafts.

Cuddington says that layout would increase booster speed and efficiency, and would reduce turbine temperature during take-off.

In addition, the engineers foresee embedding of an electrical generator/motor within the booster being directly driven by the gearbox.

In a conventional turbofan, electrical generators are located on the outside of an engine and are driven by a linkage with the powerplant's shafts.

On a medium-thrust engine like the CFM International Leap, the new booster-generator configuration could extract 2MW of electrical power, Cuddington says.

Combined with batteries on board the aircraft, the electrical generator/motor layout could be used to provide power assistance for take-off and climb, he says.

Cuddington notes that the battery configuration would not be suitable for long-haul flight as the equipment's weight would negate any fuel efficiencies.

But for distances of 800-1,000nm (1,500-1,900km), the engineers project NOx emission reductions of up to 50% and fuel-burn savings of between 3% and 4% for single-aisle aircraft like the Airbus A320-family and Boeing 737.

Cuddington says the ""dual-drive booster"" concept can be ""tuned"" to shift the balance between NOx emissions and fuel efficiency, and that he is confident the layout would generate fuel-burn savings similar to the latest generation of engines like the Leap.

He concedes that the new layout would be incompatible with a geared-fan architecture, like on Pratt & Whitney's PW1000G and Rolls-Royce's UltraFan future engine programme. But he says the dual-drive booster would deliver notable NOx emission reductions versus latest-generation powerplants.

Patents have been secured in the UK, China and USA, and talks are under way with several engine manufacturers, including R-R, about potential application options.

Derwent has collaborated with the University of Nottingham to prove the concept's mechanical feasibility, and with Aachen University in Germany to project the engine's performance.

"Airbus secured firm orders for 93 aircraft during the Farnborough air show, taking its overall gross order total for the year so far to 354.

This indicates that the airframer has yet to firm any commitments to the new A220, following its acquisition of the Bombardier CSeries programme.

Airbus had secured gross orders for 177 single-aisle and 84 long-haul aircraft over the first half, a total of 261.

While orders for 52 aircraft mentioned at Farnborough had already been included in this first-half total, Airbus disclosed firm orders for another 93 during the show – comprising 51 A320-family, 34 A330 and eight A350 jets – taking its declared firm orders this year to 354.

This total notably omits the 60 A220s for JetBlue Airways unveiled in early July, just as Airbus took over and rebranded the CSeries programme.

The airframer had supplemented these 60 pre-show A220s for JetBlue with another 60, during Farnborough, for an unnamed US start-up carrier.

But chief commercial officer Eric Schulz, during a wrap-up briefing at the show, appeared to confirm that none of the A220s was yet in the backlog, by listing all 120 aircraft as commitments rather than firm orders.

The airframer says that, along with 93 firm orders, it took commitments for 338 aircraft at the show, in the form of memoranda of understanding.

Along with the 60 A220s for the start-up these 338 commitments included 253 A320-family jets, eight A330s and 17 A350s.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) struck a new deal for 100 passenger jets with Vietnamese budget airline VietJet Aviation JSC VJC.HM on Wednesday, deepening a battle for market share against rival Airbus (AIR.PA) in one of southeast Asia’s hottest markets.

Boeing and VietJet signed the provisional order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes worth almost $13 billion at list prices at the Farnborough Airshow in southern England.

Of these, 80 are the recently launched 737 MAX 10 - the largest version of Boeing’s best-selling 737 range - and 20 are the benchmark 737 MAX 8 model.

“The growth is incredibly strong in Southeast Asia,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Kevin McAllister. “VietJet is a major player there.”

The draft deal comes two years after Boeing upstaged Airbus by clinching an order for 100 737 MAX jets during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama.

Until then, VietJet had only ordered planes from Airbus, including a bumper order for 92 jets in December 2013.

However, aircraft finance industry sources have expressed doubts over whether all the planes on order would be delivered on schedule amid a glut of airplane orders in the region.

VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao insisted on Wednesday the airline would use both the A320 and 737 aircraft in its fleet and would have “no problem” taking delivery.

The companies said VietJet, one of the fastest-growing carriers in southeast Asia, needed the planes to satisfy surging demand on high-dense domestic routes as well as popular routes throughout Asia.

Vietnam’s first privately owned airline will become the largest MAX 10 customer in Asia once the deal is completed, with deliveries due in 2022-2025, the companies said.

"FARNBOROUGH, England/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Airplane manufacturers are working to adapt jets to reduce the number of pilots needed for long-haul flights and to build new cockpits designed for a single aviator in order to ease a global pilot shortage and cut airline costs.

FILE PHOTO: The cockpit of an Airbus A340-300 of Eurowings, a low-cost airline and fully owned subsidiary of German Lufthansa Group, is photographed as Eurowings opens a new route from Duesseldorf to New York, in Duesseldorf, Germany, April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo

Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Thales SA (TCFP.PA) expect the number of cockpit crew on long-haul flights, typically three or four, could be reduced to two from 2023 thanks to new technology to reduce pilot workload.

“That’s not an absurd date. Reducing crew on long-range looks to be the most accessible step because there is another pilot onboard,” Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus head of engineering, told Reuters at the Farnborough Airshow.

Boeing Co (BA.N) is examining the possibility of having reduced manning in the cockpit of a proposed mid-sized jet that it aims to have in service by 2025 if it proceeds with a launch decision next year, according to UBS analysts. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“You can see the drivers from both angles,” said Graham Braithwaite, Director of Transport Systems at Britain’s Cranfield University. “The technology to fly an aircraft on automatic is brilliant. The other driver in all this is that we’re really short of pilots. They’re a very expensive resource.”

The proponents of reduced numbers in the cockpit say the move, which could begin with cargo flights, is inevitable, just as pilot numbers were cut from three to two in the 1980s when the flight engineer position was axed due to improved design on new jets like the Boeing 757.

Airlines globally could save around $15 billion a year by going down to a single pilot, UBS said, and at a time of a pilot shortage this would help ensure there are enough aviators to serve a fast-growing industry.

Replacing the vast array of knobs and switches with more digital interfaces familiar to today’s teenagers could also help to shorten the amount of time it takes to train pilots, thus easing the shortage.

Ultimately, the goal would be for a fully autonomous commercial jet along the lines of a driverless car, although that technology, which requires clean-sheet jet designs from the major manufacturers, could take until 2040, according to an estimate from Thales.

“I would compare autonomy to an open-heart surgery of our systems. All of our systems are specified to have permanently two persons in the cockpit,” Airbus’ Dumont said.

Critics, however, say there are good safety reasons for having more than two pilots in the cockpit on long-haul flights and at least two on shorter journeys, with the costs outweighed by the benefits.

INCREASED VULNERABILITY

For example, reducing cockpit numbers to one in the cruise phase of a long-haul flight could increase fatigue and vulnerability in the event of an unexpected in-flight incident while the other pilot is resting, said three pilots who spoke to Reuters, pointing to the Air France 447 crash in 2009.

Even with three pilots on board, the A330 was not recovered from a high altitude stall. In that case, the two more junior aviators were at the controls and the captain, once retrieved from resting, was unable to intervene in time to save the plane.

“I have experienced the simulation of what they went through and, even being aware that it is about to happen, it is very disconcerting,” said Murray Butt, the president of the Qantas pilots union. “I can’t imagine what it would be like for two low-time pilots in the middle of the night.”

Other concerning scenarios include the deliberate crash of a Germanwings jet by one of its pilots in 2015 and the risk of a single pilot suffering from an in-flight health problem.

Moving to a single pilot would also create training difficulties, said Stuart Beveridge, an Australian commercial pilot and aviation researcher, because the first officer role is considered an apprentice step before taking on the responsibilities of a captain.

The financial benefits of reducing crew numbers could also be marginal, said aviation consultant James Halstead, because airline cost savings would likely be passed through to passengers in the form of lower ticket prices.

“On long-haul, crewing is a tiny proportion of the cost, compared to the fuel and the capital cost of the equipment,” he added. “It outweighs paying the salary of one pilot.”

The flying public also has concerns; a UBS poll found only 13 percent of respondents would take a jet with a single pilot.

FORGING AHEAD

Regardless of the concerns, manufacturers are pushing ahead with projects like embedding artificial intelligence into cockpits and connectivity that allows for decision-making on the ground.

In an industry where safety is paramount, reducing cockpit crew numbers won’t occur without significant testing and certification from regulators, though.

In addition, getting airlines to spend money to retrofit their current fleet as well as cultural change to manage the new kind of pilot role will be crucial, said Christine Ourmieres-Widener, CEO of British regional carrier Flybe (FLYB.L).

“Most of the time people who are selling solutions don’t realise how complex it can be to manage change and that’s a massive change,” she said. “The technology will definitely be ready at some point but it will be a long process.”

Whether future jets will be designed for a single pilot has yet to be decided, the manufacturers said, with Airbus highlighting that new propulsion technologies also need to be considered.

“I would add that the single pilot operation is not an absolute must,” Dumont said.

“But it may be made a necessity by the fact there is a disconnect between the number of aircraft and the number of pilots.”",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s AirAsia Group Bhd (AIRA.KL) is set to confirm and expand an order for A330neo long-haul passenger jets, according to sources, handing European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA) a last-minute boost at the Farnborough Airshow on Thursday.

AirAsia is not expected to place additional single-aisle Airbus jet order as it expands A330neo order, sources said.

The company was discussing the possible purchase of another 100 Airbus A321neo jets as Fernandes and Airbus went down to the wire in parallel negotiations for an expanded order for larger A330neo jets, industry sources said on Sunday.

The airline said it would hold a media event on Thursday in Kuala Lumpur at 5:30 p.m. local time (0930 GMT) for a major announcement related to developing long-haul operations, which are operated by its AirAsia X Bhd (AIRX.KL) arm.

AirAsia X has a firm order for 66 of the fuel-efficient A330neo widebody jets to replace its older first-generation A330s but it has been pushing back the delivery dates. It is Airbus’ biggest customer for the A330neo and the widebodies will help meet its ambition of returning to the Kuala Lumpur-London route it dropped in 2012 due to low demand and high fuel prices.

The airline also has a firm order for 10 A350s placed in 2009, but Fernandes in April said that jet was “too expensive” and would not be purchased.

AirAsia has been a steadfast Airbus (AIR.PA) narrow-body and wide-body customer, but recently the company has talked to Boeing Co (BA.N) about buying the rival 787 jet as an alternative, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters in April.

Boeing is the world’s largest planemaker and its commercial backlog is nearly 10 times that of its defence business. The company on Thursday said it won 528 new orders and commitments for commercial aircraft at the Farnborough Airshow this week.

International demand for weapons and defence products and services is also increasing steadily, Gene Cunningham, Boeing’s head of international sales, said in an interview.

Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security business had a backlog of $50 billion with 36 percent destined for non-U.S. customers, the company said on its first quarter earnings call. That compares to $415 billion in commercial backlog.

Over the next 10 years, Cunningham said, “We see the international (sales) number growing to somewhere in the 40 percent range, but we also see the company growing.”

Big wins in the domestic defence sector could alter that forecast, he said.

Boeing is focused on several large competitions in Europe, including Germany’s push to buy around 90 new jets to replace its ageing Tornado fleet.

Germany has said it will prioritise a purchase of more Eurofighter jets, but is also looking at Boeing’s F/A-18E/F and F-15 fighter jets, as well as Lockheed Martin Co’s (LMT.N) stealthy F-35 fighter.

Boeing is also eyeing a potential sale of Apache helicopters to Poland as a part of the ongoing KRUK competition that could be decided in 2019. Cunningham said Poland could order about 32 choppers, although numbers have ranged from 16 to 64.

Boeing is also eyeing Switzerland’s competition for a new fighter jet, Cunningham said.

Under its Air2030 programme, Switzerland is seeking to procure new combat aircraft and ground-based air defences in a programme valued at up to 8 billion Swiss francs ($8.08 billion).

Joining a chorus of concerns over the pace of exit negotiations from companies like Airbus and BMW, Dassault CEO Eric Trappier said aerospace companies needed more clarity on the break-up.

“They want in a certain way to divorce. The question after the divorce, are you still friends? The answer I think is yes. Are you still countries in geographic Europe? The answer is yes,” Trappier said.

“The only question now is what are going to be the new agreements of the future. We should in a very short time start discussion about a new agreement between the UK and the EU”.

Trappier issued the appeal on behalf of French and European aerospace companies in an interview with Reuters at the Farnborough Airshow this week.

Airbus has warned that production could be affected if Britain leaves the EU with no decision on issues such as whether to remain in the European Aviation Safety Agency.

British Prime Minister Theresa May told aerospace officials this week her negotiating plan would be good for jobs in the sector.

“We need to understand and to know about the rules and we would like these rules to be as light as possible compared to what we had before,” Trappier said.

Trappier heads the French aerospace industry association, GIFAS, and European lobbying group ASD, which represents the European aerospace, defence and space sectors in Brussels.

Trappier took a sanguine view about growing trade and political tensions between the United States and Europe, such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s description of the EU this week as a “foe,” but called for a stronger Europe to defend its interests.

“I think we need to be careful about what is said and what is a reality. As far as GIFAS is concerned and I am concerned we don’t see the United States as an enemy. We see them as a big partner,” he said.

“Obviously when you are speaking about a partner it has to be based on a certain balance; it can’t be the strong and the weak. ... I may say also it is time for Europe to organise itself to be strong... If you are a strong EU speaking with a strong U.S. then I think balance is going to be back.”",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Executives from top aerospace and aviation companies called on Thursday for stepped-up efforts to attract more women, saying this could help solve looming shortages of pilots, mechanics and top managers in the traditionally male-dominated sector.

The industries are coming under scrutiny because of the low numbers of women employed as senior executives or airline pilots. At the same time, a growing shortage of pilots is putting the sector’s recent growth at risk.

The head of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, caused a storm last month when he said that a woman could not do his job, although he later apologised, saying his comments had been intended as a joke and were taken out of context.

Charlotte Pedersen, chief executive of Luxaviation Helicopters, a private aviation operator, said urgent action was needed since the sector faced a potential “huge gap” in management capacity in a decade as current executives retired.

“We can’t just recruit from half the population,” Pedersen, the first female pilot in the Danish air force, told a panel discussion at the Farnborough Airshow.

Marnie Munn, an airline captain with easyJet (EZJ.L), told the conference that only three to four percent of pilots globally were women.

Jane Basson, chief of staff to Airbus CEO Tom Enders, said women now accounted for 17.5 percent of the company’s workforce of 140,000 but that was just a tick up from 15 percent in 2005.

“It’s not progressing fast enough,” she said, adding that her company was now using data analysis tools to understand why it was proving so difficult to recruit and retain women.

In addition, she said Airbus (AIR.PA) was using tools such as smart phone applications to provide encouragement and support to workers, but could tailor those to reach women specifically.

Hundreds of industry executives attended the panel, with many signing a UK charter that commits organisations to support promotion of women to senior roles, set their own targets and report on their progress to boost accountability.

More than 50 aviation and aerospace companies with operations in Britain have signed the charter, and the number is growing, said Katherine Bennett, a senior vice president with Airbus. It is modeled on a similar pledge in the finance sector.

Signatories also agree to have a senior executive oversee diversity efforts, and to link pay of senior executives to meeting internal targets on gender diversity and inclusion.

Budget airline easyJet has a target that 20 percent of its new pilots should be female by 2020 and British Aviation Minister Liz Sugg said other firms were taking similar steps.

But more work was needed to close pay gaps that often exceeded 50 percent in the aerospace sector, add women to corporate boards and recruit more female pilots, she said, noting that women make up just 5 percent of pilots at UK-registered airlines.

“We really do have a long way to go before these barriers disappear altogether. There are fundamental gender issues in aviation and aerospace,” Sugg said.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is stockpiling parts in case of a hard Brexit and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) is months away from doing so. But for smaller aerospace companies that supply them, Britain’s departure from the EU could be much more challenging.

The largest aerospace sector in Europe and second in the world behind the United States, the British industry generates exports worth 30 billion pounds a year and sustains 123,000 direct jobs, plus as many again indirectly.

Manufacturing planes and engines requires components to be at factories on a just-in-time basis. A disorderly or no-deal Brexit would threaten the smooth flow of parts across borders and prevent European regulatory approval for aerospace products.

However much planning the industry giants do, they could still be damaged via their supply chains if component suppliers are not ready.

John Rainey, chairman of Denroy, a maker of injected moulded components used on Airbus planes, has contingency plans in place, but won’t sign off on any changes for the company of 165 employees until he knows what Brexit means.

“Everybody says you need a plan but we don’t know what to plan for or against. We’re going to conferences now and we’re told to be very afraid but we don’t know what we have to be afraid of,” he said at the Farnborough airshow, the annual showcase for the British aerospace industry.

Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc.

Alert to the potential problem, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for aircraft and ships, has started to talk to smaller suppliers to look at “where some of the hotspots might be”, the company’s president of civil aerospace, Chris Cholerton, said.

“We’ve got a bit of a heatmap of levels of risk,” he said.

WORST-CASE SCENARIO

Slow progress in the Brexit talks has convinced Europe’s Airbus, which makes the wings for its commercial aircraft in Wales, to activate plans to prepare for a worst-case, no-deal scenario.

But few of the 4,000 companies in Airbus’s UK supply chain, many of which are small and medium-sized companies, have dedicated teams and sophisticated plans in place, a chink in the armour of big companies.

“There’s a limit to how much they (big companies) can do in terms of digging down,” said David Stewart, aerospace partner at consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.

“There’s a small company that does this piece of bearing, clip, pump. You can’t go and check every one of those single companies to see how well prepared they are.”

Big companies hope that building up stocks of parts will allow factories to continue producing even if goods are held up at the border between Britain and the EU.

Depending on the future relationship, goods could require customs declarations and checks at borders, a major risk for Airbus whose components can cross borders two or three times before products are finished.

Tony Wood, CEO of Meggitt (MGGT.L), which makes wheels and brakes for planemakers and has 11,000 employees globally, says he has examined how the company would fare under all the different outcomes. “We’ve done so many scenarios around Brexit planning,” he said.

Meggitt, which said only 5 percent of its business is trading directly between the UK and Europe, says it can cope with the extra administration.

“On day one, if there is a requirement for extra processing and paperwork to clear customs and such like, then yes, we have a solution to put people in place to do that,” Wood said.

PAPERWORK

But for Northern Ireland-based Denroy, it’s another story. Rainey, who owns the firm, said more paperwork could mean extra staff and extra cost for a small business to absorb.

“I’m worried about ... all the additional documentation requirements. The implications for two more employees is 60,000 quid (pounds) you know,” he said.

The head of France’s Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA), Eric Trappier, urged Britain and the EU on Thursday to settle differences over Brexit and define a new partnership as quickly as possible to avoid hurting hundreds of suppliers.

British Prime Minister Theresa May published a plan for the UK’s future relationship with the EU in July which was generally well-received by industry, but even if she can secure enough support for it at home, she still needs to win agreement from the EU.

Under her plan, Britain would share a common rule book on goods with the EU and continue to participate in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), addressing a key worry for the industry which needs its parts to be EASA-approved to continue flying.

If that fails, companies with existing facilities in mainland Europe can use those for approving parts.

With six factories in Europe, Meggitt has options.

“There are a number of alternatives as to how you ultimately will clear those parts. We have operations in France and Switzerland,” Wood said, adding that shipping parts there for EASA approval would be “a very extreme scenario”.

Rolls is one step ahead, putting in place plans to move the design approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany.

But setting up shop in Europe isn’t an option for many of the thousands of small and medium-sized companies, and the aerospace and defence industry body ADS said it isn’t advising them to move, or seeing evidence that they’re doing so.

“At this point we’re saying you do need to be aware, you need to have understood where the vulnerabilities lie,” ADS Chief Executive Paul Everitt said.

While the costs of Brexit are worrying for some, some smaller companies see an opportunity in the regulatory and customs difficulties that could lie ahead.

The boss of Moyola Precision Engineering, a supplier of titanium and aluminium components to Airbus and Boeing, said it could win new business if it adapts quickly enough.

It employs 120 people at its base in Northern Ireland.

“Over the years we have been working to reduce our cost and to put ourselves in a situation where we can still be cost competitive,” said Managing Director Mark Semple, who owns the 18 million pound turnover business with his father.

“You have to keep doing these things, Brexit’s just another thing that encourages you to look to continue to take out cost.”

While the show notably featured a series of commercial declarations centred on customers who had chosen to remain undisclosed, just one firm order – for eight A350s – was among them.

"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N) claimed victory on Thursday after outselling rival Airbus (AIR.PA) at this week’s Farnborough Airshow, where the world’s largest planemakers repeated last year’s comparable haul of around 900 orders with the help of leasing industry demand.

The world’s largest planemaker said it had won 528 orders and commitments at the event in southern England, while Airbus reported 431 new deals, or 371 excluding the recently acquired Bombardier CSeries, now rebranded A220.

But the tally was overshadowed by some 400 deals where the names of the buyers were withheld - unusual at an event mainly designed to attract publicity, and prompting one delegate leaving Farnborough to quip that he had attended a “UFO show”.

Airbus blamed the incognito wave on trade tensions that had made some firms nervous about appearing to side with the United States or other economic powers amid heated trade rhetoric.

“The fact that the world is waking up to see which tweet has hit which part of the world doesn’t really help,” Airbus sales chief Eric Schulz said, in an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s frequent use of Twitter.

But the publicity-shy trend was also widely seen as evidence that both giants were anxious to boost their tallies.

Planemakers in some cases accelerate semi-finished business or use shows as a deadline to get airlines to commit even if they are not ready to be named, people familiar with talks said.

“The big ‘thing’ at this air show has been unknown customers sort-of showing some interest in buying planes,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said.

One airline often in the limelight is fast-growing AirAsia (AIRA.KL), whose co-founders held announcements in Farnborough and Kuala Lumpur to hand Airbus a coveted order for 34 extra A330neo jets, expanding its purchase to 100.

Negotiations went down to the wire after AirAsia, in a rift with its longstanding supplier, threatened to defect to Boeing for its long-haul needs. The deal saw AirAsia renegotiate and reconfirm an existing order for 66 of the slow-selling A330neos.

Airbus’s hopes of securing an immediate top-up order for 100 smaller A321neo from the same airline were dashed, however.

VIETNAM CONTEST

The A330neo has been hit by a series of market losses to the newer Boeing 787, leaving it exposed to an AirAsia cancellation.

The battle for sales in that 250-300-seat segment was underscored on Thursday when Boeing firmed up an order for at least 10 787s from Hawaiian Airlines, secured at the expense of the A330neo.

Boeing sales chief Ihssane Mounir, declaring himself in a “Hawaiian mood” as he addressed reporters sporting a Hawaiian-style shirt, said Boeing remained ahead on wide-body orders.

In another key battleground, Airbus hit back by grabbing an order for 50 A321neo jets from Vietnam’s VietJet VJC.HM, 24 hours after the fast-growing budget carrier placed an order for 100 737 MAX aircraft across the tarmac at Boeing. The A321neo has been far outselling Boeing in that 220-seat niche.

VietJet has ordered heavily from both Airbus and Boeing, reflecting Vietnam’s attempts to diversify foreign and defence policies and build business relations with multiple suppliers.

The show was also a test for small jetmakers in the process of being gobbled up by Airbus and Boeing. Airbus recently completed its acquisition of the A220 and Boeing tentatively agreed to buy the commercial aircraft unit of Brazil’s Embraer.

Airbus sold 60 A220 and Embraer sold 300 jets, including many too small to compete with the A220, worth $15 billion.

Leasing companies led this week’s charge of buyers, including some that have not previously turned up to buy directly from manufacturers, preferring instead to buy freshly built jets from airlines and then rent them back at a profit.

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Citigroup raised its stock market rating on Airbus (AIR.PA) to “buy” from “neutral”, citing positive impacts from pricing and more favourable foreign exchange movements.

“In 2023, we now see foreign exchange providing a 300-400 million euros tailwind versus 2017 compared with a 900-1,000 million euros headwind previously. A320 pricing looking positive as sold out to 2024,” Citigroup wrote in a research note.

The German company was always seen as a temporary part of Airbus, and the sale indicates that concerns about this part of the planemaker’s supply chain have eased.

After failing to sell the supplier in 2015, the sources said Airbus was poised to launch a new auction in the autumn for the company, which may be valued at 500-600 million euros ($582-$698 mln).

Investment bank Lazard (LAZ.N) has been brought in to organize the deal, the sources said.

Airbus and Lazard declined to comment.

The planned divestiture comes as Airbus and its rival Boeing are concerned global trade tensions could deter airlines from buying jetliners, although geopolitical uncertainty has allowed the two companies to sell more weapons.

At this week’s Farnborough Airshow, the world’s largest planemakers repeated last year’s comparable haul of around 900 orders, but the tally was overshadowed by some 400 deals where the names of the buyers were withheld.

PFW has its origins in a German airplane manufacturer Pfalz-Flugzeugwerke, which produced military airplanes in both world wars. It later became part of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, before it was sold first to its staff and then in 2001 to buyout firm Safeguard, which still owns a minority stake.

In Airbus’ earlier bid to sell the company in 2015, the business attracted interest from Eaton (ETN.N), Parker (PH.N), Total’s Hutchinson (TOTF.PA) as well as buyout groups such as Bridgepoint, Bregal and Liberty Hall. None were willing to meet Airbus’ asking price at the time.

Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, told Reuters in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow this week that Boeing was watching the situation but that it was premature to make more definitive statements.

“They are still going through own defence reviews and understanding where they’re going,” she said.

“If there is an opportunity where the Boeing Company can participate and play, we will be absolutely honoured and thrilled to be part of that journey,” she added.

Britain this week unveiled its plans to build a stealthy new future fighter jet called Tempest, launching a rival to the Franco-German programme first unveiled in the summer of 2017.

Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) are leading the Franco-German programme, while the British project will be run by BAE Systems (BAES.L), Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI), engine maker Rolls Royce (RR.L), and missile maker MBDA.

It remains unclear whether the two projects could merge after Britain’s exit from the European Union, or whether Britain will forge new alliances, perhaps with Sweden’s Saab (SAABb.ST), maker of the Gripen fighter jet.

It may also look to Boeing (BA.N), which recently teamed with Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and has close ties to Saab, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group.

Teaming up with BAE, Saab and possibly Embraer on a new fighter would provide a serious counterweight to the Franco-German project, which has not yet awarded initial study contracts to Airbus and Dassault.

It would also offer Boeing, which builds F/A-18E/F and F-15 fighters, a chance to get back into a new fighter development programme after losing out to Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter contract in 2001.",Reuters,0

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation says the days of delays to its MRJ regional jet are behind it, with flight displays at the Farnborough Airshow marking a turning point for the plane.

The aircraft, Japan’s first passenger plane since the 1960s, was back in the air on Wednesday after management kept it on the ground the previous day following a prang with a tow vehicle.

The program has been delayed by several years, with first customer ANA (9202.T) now expecting the 90-seater plane in 2020, rather than 2013 as originally envisaged, and there are concerns the delays have hampered the jet’s prospects.

“This is the turning point, demonstrating our aircraft,” chief development officer Alex Bellamy told Reuters.

He didn’t expect new orders at the air show, but is using the opportunity to show the jet to prospective customers.

Asked about the delays, Bellamy said that with over 2,000 hours of flight testing behind it, any major problems should now have been found.

“Our focus today is on keeping the schedule. The schedule we set a year ago, we’re still meeting that today. Those days (of delays) are behind us.”

Bellamy said that amid consolidation in the aerospace market, the MRJ provided competition.

“As we see consolidation in general in the marketplace, we bring much needed choice,” he said.

The project is backed by Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (7011.T), which already makes aircraft components, such as wing boxes, for the Boeing (BA.N) 787.

Daniel Lochmann, global marketing communications director at MHI, said that making a whole new jet helped it improve manufacturing processes.

"MILAN (Reuters) - EasyJet EZJ.L and Lufthansa LHAG.DE are still interested in Alitalia after an Italian minister said this week the government wants the majority of the loss-making carrier under state control, the British and German carriers said.

EasyJet, Lufthansa LHAG.DE, and budget carrier Wizz Air WIZZ.L submitted expressions of interest earlier this year in at least parts of Alitalia, but the lengthy formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy, which finally came to power in June, delayed the process.

New Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said this week there was a need for 51 percent of Alitalia to be kept in Italian hands “but with a strong investor next to it ... (Alitalia) needs to return to being a true flag carrier”.

Lufthansa has repeatedly said that the Italian market is important for it but that Alitalia must be restructured before it would invest.

A spokesman said the German company had already submitted a document to this effect to the new government. “We can imagine further talks on this basis,” he said on Friday.

EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said at the Farnborough Airshow this week that the company remained interested in parts of Alitalia but needed to study the details of what the new government is proposing.

Alitalia, once a symbol of Italy’s post-war economic boom but struggling to compete against low-cost carriers and high speed trains in recent years, was put under special administration last year after workers rejected its latest rescue plan. (Full Story)

Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs Matteo Salvini has said Alitalia was well-placed to return to profitability and “if there are serious private partners, so much the better”.

“The only think we won’t allow is a break-up (of the company),” he said.

However, sector analysts remain dubious that the government will find an investor willing to put money into an Alitalia in which the state has a say, especially given past political meddling that has failed to return the company to profitability.

“Even if the state takes only a minority stake in Alitalia, no investor will dare getting close given what happened in the past,” said Andrea Giuricin, CEO of TRA Consulting and author of “The endless privatisation of Alitalia”.

Repeated state bailouts have cost Italian taxpayers around 10 billion euros over a decade, Giuricin estimates, yet the airline’s situation remains precarious: the carrier is losing at least one million euros per day, he added.

"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Britain’s space industry has taken a big step forward. A plan to create Europe’s first-ever rocket launch pad taps into a commercial desire to send satellites into the Earth’s orbit. The bright spot helps offset the Brexit-related row about the UK’s membership of the European Union’s Galileo satellite-navigation project.

Building a “spaceport” near Scotland’s northern tip could be regarded as an accident of geography. For safety reasons, vertical rocket launches cannot occur in Europe’s land-locked and highly populated mainland. Back in 2010 the UK government planned for a time when Britain’s space industry – underpinned by companies like Airbus, CGI and Qinetiq – could take advantage of the growing demand for small satellites, which are cheaper to build and launch. According to the UK Space Agency, these are popular with broadcasters, telecom providers, and users of navigation and positioning services.

The public investment is modest. U.S. giant Lockheed Martin and UK rocket maker Orbex will share a little over 30 million pounds with a local Scottish agency. Yet the project could lure specialist manufacturers and tech startups. Britain’s business ministry estimates the spaceport could generate annual revenue of 3.8 billion pounds. That’s small when compared with the global space sector’s projected annual turnover of 400 billion pounds by 2030. Nevertheless, it’s a valuable boost. The UK Space Agency estimates government investment in the industry to date has produced an average sixfold return.

Britain could use the lift. European Commissioner Michel Barnier insists that the country won’t be able to take advantage of the military and security aspects of the Galileo project after it leaves the EU, as only the bloc’s member states can share and make use of such sensitive information. That’s frustrating for the UK government, which has contributed 12 percent of the project’s cost of 10 billion euros. Going it alone could cost the taxpayer between 3 billion pounds and 5 billion pounds, then Defence Minister Guto Bebb told a parliamentary committee last month.

Being an island has its advantages when it comes to launching satellites. But leaving the EU could nonetheless make joining the space race a costly exercise.",Reuters,0
"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Britain’s showy launch of a new fighter jet project at this week’s Farnborough Airshow has laid bare political tensions that are threatening to tear Europe apart and deepened scepticism about the future of European defence cooperation.

The new UK programme - launched with 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) of seed money just nine months before Britain leaves the European Union - rivals a Franco-German project begun over a year ago that has yet to be funded.

France had hoped to work with Britain on the project, bringing together Europe’s two biggest military powers, but turned to Germany after failing to make progress on a Franco-British drone programme.

This had got caught up in Britain’s political turmoil, with the government not only at odds with the EU over their future relationship - casting doubt over defence and security cooperation - but also at war with itself. The junior minister responsible for defence procurement became the latest government official to resign this week over Brexit negotiating strategy.

Impatient industry executives say Europe must move quickly, setting aside national employment interests and political divisions, or risk losing out in a global market to bigger players led by the United States, or even China in the future.

“What we want is new developments, new programmes,” Eric Trappier, head of France’s Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA) told Reuters. “Whether we do it with the Germans or ... the British, we need facts.”

Dassault and Airbus (AIR.PA) are leading the Franco-German programme, while the UK project will be run by BAE Systems (BAES.L), Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI), engine maker Rolls-Royce (RR.L) and missile maker MBDA.

Industry executives say the two projects could merge after Brexit, but Britain may also forge new alliances, perhaps with Sweden’s Saab (SAABb.ST), maker of the Gripen fighter jet.

It may also look to Boeing (BA.N), which lost out to Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) on the U.S. F-35 warplane contract in 2001, and has since teamed up with Saab and Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA), said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group, a defence and aerospace analysis group.

Boeing’s defence chief Leanne Caret said her company would be “thrilled to be part of that journey”, but Britain and its partners must first determine their requirements.

Given the huge investment required, Leonardo’s chief strategy officer, Giovanni Soccodato said Europe must share out work on sensors, airframe and other parts, instead of building whole jets in four different countries, as done by the Eurofighter, Europe’s last big fighter development programme.

“The only way to survive and be economically viable ... is to cooperate and do programmes jointly,” he told Reuters. “It’s a schizophrenic approach to be pushing for European defence cooperation, but not wanting to give up national capabilities.”

European states have historically opted to safeguard high-paying jobs and national security capabilities, resulting in overcapacity in several markets, including fighter jets.

France, for instance, was initially part of the Eurofighter project in the 1980s, but dropped out to build its own rival Rafale warplane. Its industrial demands make it “inconceivable” that the two rival programmes could be joined, said Aboulafia.

However, competitive pressures should force a more pragmatic outcome this time, Airbus Defence chief Dirk Hoke told Reuters. “We cannot afford to continue this fragmentation,” he said.

MASSIVE COST

Industry executives familiar with the development of the F-35 - the world’s most advanced warplane - caution that European states face a massive bill and extensive technological difficulties to develop a rival aircraft.

“The United States spent about $50 billion to develop the F-35,” said former chief Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall. “Even if you discount the fact it was three different models, that’s an enormous barrier to entry for anybody else.”

The British defence ministry earmarked on Monday 2 billion pounds in public funds for the project up to 2025, but is seeking international partners to help foot the larger bill.

To help make the pitch, UK officials gave military officers from allied countries a preview of a mockup of the new aircraft at the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world’s largest military air show, days before its public unveiling.

Britain is already in talks with Sweden and Japan, among others, but analysts say the likes of South Korea and Turkey, or arms-buying Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia, could be options.

The best choice, given China’s growing might and Russia’s increased military ambitions, would be for Europe to join forces with the United States, said Morten Brandtzaeg, president and chief executive of Norway’s Nammo AS aerospace group.

“Europe and the United States together are just a little bit more than one-tenth of the world’s population. For the Western world, we need to share technology. Then we would have the economies of scale to meet these new growing economies.”

"The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site in Belfort, April 27, 2014. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A quarterly earnings report without big writedowns represents a victory of sorts for General Electric boss John Flannery. Sure, the U.S. conglomerate’s earnings fell by nearly one-third year-on-year in the three months ended June 30 – but at least the nature of the challenge is now clear.

GE slashed its cost base by $1.1 billion in the first half, putting Flannery more than halfway to his 2018 target of $2 billion. The group’s healthcare division boosted revenue by 6 percent in the second quarter and operating profit by twice that rate. The unit’s spinoff, due to take place by the end of next year, should help GE halve the level of debt attached to its industrial businesses.

The real worry remains GE’s power division, bulked up under Jeff Immelt, Flannery’s predecessor. Orders fell by 26 percent year-on-year in the latest period, and operating profit more than halved. Demand for its gas-powered electricity turbines is weak, and will remain so. Meanwhile, GE’s renewables division isn’t fully benefiting from the industry’s shift. It focuses on wind power but not solar, and fierce competition drove double-digit declines in orders and revenue in the quarter.

These are at least things investors can see coming. The previous two quarters included $8 billion of charges for exposure to long-term-care insurance losses and mortgage litigation at its GE Capital unit. There’s none of that this time, though the financing arm remains a black box and will need a $3 billion capital injection next year.

That leaves aviation – GE’s best-performing bit. Orders jumped 29 percent in the quarter, and look set for continued strong growth after notching $22 billion in commitments at Britain’s Farnborough air show last week. The division generated half of the group’s operating profit, and more than 80 percent of what will be the new GE. Like an aircraft, GE really should have more than one engine, but this is at least enough to stay aloft.",Reuters,0
"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA is seen at the company's headquarters in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio/File photo

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Deliveries by Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) fell in the second quarter from a year earlier and its backlog fell sharply as it dropped an order from an inactive customer, according to a securities filing on Friday.

The planemaker delivered 28 commercial jets to airlines in the three months through June, down from 35 planes a year earlier. Executive jet deliveries fell to 20 aircraft, from 24 jets a year before.

Embraer shares fell nearly 2 percent in Friday trading, pressured by a sharp appreciation of Brazil’s currency, which hurts the planemaker’s export-focused business.

Embraer’s firm order backlog, a gauge of expected revenue, fell sharply as the planemaker removed an order for 50 of its next-generation E2 passenger jets placed by Indian carrier Air Costa, which suspended service last year.

With that, the backlog fell to $17.4 billion at the end of June. In March, the backlog stood at $19.5 billion under a new accounting method including all service and support contracts. Excluding most service contracts the backlog stood at $18.1 billion in March.

Analysts on the BTG Pactual sales desk say the loss of the Air Costa order had been widely expected.

Embraer drummed up fresh orders for more than 100 passenger jets at a the Farnborough Airshow this week as it sought to fight off a partnership of Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) on a competing small narrowbody jet.

Embraer has reached a preliminary agreement to hand over control of its commercial jet operations to Boeing Co (BA.N) in an effort to square off against the Airbus-Bombardier alliance. However, executives said they do not expect to finalize the deal until late next year, forcing Embraer to compete single-handedly against the European and Canadian rivals.",Reuters,0
"(Reuters) - Aerospace parts maker Esterline Technologies Corp (ESL.N) is exploring a potential sale, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.

Esterline did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Shares of the company, which has a market capitalisation of more than $2 billion, were up around 10 percent at $83 in afternoon trading.

Esterline makes cockpit components and sensors for commercial jetliners, business jets and military aircraft such as Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jets.

"UK maintenance provider Monarch Aircraft Engineering (MAEL) will in September open a new component repair shop, less than a year after its parent airline ceased operations.

The new shop, part of a plan aimed at more than doubling MAEL's business, is located in Northampton – about halfway between headquarters, in Luton, and a hangar in Birmingham. A staff of around 20 will be employed at the shop – half of them new recruits, with the other half to come from the repair facility in Luton.

MAEL managing director Chris Dare told FlightGlobal in June that the location had been selected primarily to support hangar facilities in Luton and Birmingham. But he notes the good availability of manual technical skills in Northampton's labour pool, thanks to the area's engineering heritage, and says staff numbers are set to increase in the future.

He says Northampton is a suitable location to serve a range of additional airports within a 2h radius. The new shop represents a £2 million ($2.6 million) investment and includes composite-repair, sheet-metal, coating and component-painting facilities.

It is the first step of an expansion plan MAEL is enacting after its emergence as the only division to survive Monarch's administration process.

LAST YEAR'S BLEAK OUTLOOK

When, in October 2017, Monarch Airlines stopped flying, the immediate prospect for MAEL was ""very bleak"", Dare tells FlightGlobal. He says the former parent's 35-strong Airbus A320-family fleet had been scheduled to generate around 85% of MAEL's activity during winter 2017-8.

Just before Monarch's collapse, Virgin Atlantic had signed a deal to have its Boeing 787s serviced at MAEL's Birmingham hangar. But Dare admits that for a six-week period running until mid-November ""we didn't do a lot"" of maintenance activity.

A voluntary redundancy plan was implemented for back-office staff as a means of cutting overhead, but thanks to ""some magic"" from the MRO providers commercial team, base maintenance activity picked up, with customers including Air Astana, Air Malta, Icelandair and Swedish freight specialist West Atlantic. And eventually MAEL registered around 15% more man-hours during the 2017-8 winter than in the same period a year earlier.

Staff numbers have increased to around 780, from 730 in 2017. This includes employees transferred a part of a line-maintenance deal with Thomas Cook Airlines – disclosed in May – under which nearly 70 UK technicians moved from the leisure carrier to MAEL at stations at East Midlands, Glasgow, London Gatwick and Newcastle airports. Dare acknowledges, however, that line-maintenance activity has not returned to its level before Monarch's administration.

In Luton, where MAEL conducts heavy checks, the maintenance provider is almost fully booked until April 2019, Dare says. The site comprises two hangars, each of which can accommodate aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 767. Newer widebodies with longer wingspans, like the 787 or A330, are too big for the building, however.

The company's purpose-built Birmingham hangar – opened in 2013 – can accommodate two 777s or up to 10 single-aisle aircraft, and tends to be used for lighter checks. Virgin's 787s are being serviced there, and Flybe has for several years been a long-term customer for overnight checks on Bombardier Q400 turboprops and Embraer E-Jets.

Additionally, MAEL uses its Birmingham facility to support, on Boeing's behalf, operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 1000-powered 787s, which are affected by the engine's durability issues.

The uptick in airframe maintenance has been helped by sterling's depreciation since the UK's Brexit vote in 2016, says Dare. While he concedes that the MRO's services are ""never going to be as cheap as eastern Europe"", he does not see the company's location as a disadvantage in attracting contracts for labour-intensive checks.

""We are not short, at the moment, of opportunities for base maintenance,"" he says. ""Not just one or two inputs, but big inputs on multi-year deals.""

GROWTH PLAN

Dare declined to provide FlightGlobal with revenue figures, as MAEL's financial and ownership circumstances changed with the reorganisation as a standalone company. However, he says the MRO intends to double turnover through organic growth until 2023, and to grow its business a further 35% through acquisitions.

MAEL will use takeovers to broaden its capabilities with ""complementary services"", Dare indicates. He says the MRO provider is ""not constrained by UK borders"" and could target acquisitions ""further afield"".

While doubling MAEL's business will initially involve efficiency efforts to create ""a bit more capacity"" at Luton and Birmingham, the growth plan foresees the establishment of additional base-maintenance facilities. Dare says the company is evaluating ""a couple of options"" for expansion at existing or new locations.

Although MAEL has received partnership proposals to establish base-maintenance facilities abroad, Dare says the MRO provider's strategy ""at the moment"" is to exploit base-maintenance opportunities in its home market.

However, Dare rules out a return to Manchester as a base-maintenance location, following MAEL's closure of a hangar there in 2016. That site was subsequently acquired by UK leisure carrier Jet2.

BOEING PARTNERSHIPS

Central to MAEL's growth plan is a co-operation agreement with Boeing. A year ago, the US airframer and Monarch disclosed the establishment of a joint venture to support third-party maintenance customers under Boeing's newly formed Global Fleet Care aftermarket programme.

MAEL was a maintenance partner in Boeing's previous GoldCare aftermarket scheme, and used its capabilities – particularly for the 787 – to serve operators both on the manufacturer's behalf and as an independent MRO provider. But the establishment of a joint venture deepens the partnership with the airframer.

Meanwhile, Boeing is in the process of constructing a maintenance hangar at Gatwick airport to support Global Fleet Care customers. The facility is scheduled to open in 2019. Norwegian's 787s will be serviced at the new facility, under a Global Fleet Care contract. The Scandinavian carrier has stationed Dreamliners and 737s at Gatwick, with both types receiving line maintenance support from MAEL at the airport.

Boeing previously told FlightGlobal that it will operate the new hangar at Gatwick.

Elsewhere, preparations are under way to reorganise MAEL's shareholding structure. Monarch Group – including the MRO provider – was owned by private equity firm Greybull Capital. While other assets of the group were subject to insolvency proceedings, MAEL's shares are currently held by an entity named Monarch 2011. Dare says Greybull remains MAEL's ""economic owner"", and he expects that the shareholding will return to direct ownership by the financial firm ""soon"".

Around two-third of MAEL's business come from airlines based in mainland Europe, but during the June interview Dare showed no concern about the UK's scheduled departure from the EU in March 2019.

He recalled that after the 2016 referendum there had been uncertainty about potential loss of European customers and of EU staff members, but insisted that there had been no decline in demand. No customer, he said, had raised questions with the service provider regarding MAEL's post-Brexit regulatory situation. Additionally, there had been ""no drop"" in applications for technical roles by EU nationals.

Dare acknowledged a possibility of using a EU subsidiary to maintain certification under the European Aviation Safety Agency were the UK were to leave the bloc without a deal covering aviation. MAEL already has EU subsidiaries and has considered such an option, Dare said. But he added: ""We have not gone too far down the line on that at the moment.""

He remained confident of regulatory alignment with EASA. Besides, he said, any Plan B involving a European subsidiary does not represent a ""burning risk at the moment, given what we went through nine months ago"".",Flight Global,0
"There were no mega deals or aircraft launches, but anyone who thought this year’s Farnborough would pass with a whimper was mistaken. Swelling backlogs and a straining supply chain appear to be doing little to deter demand for Airbus and Boeing single-aisle types, even though many customers will not get their hands on purchases until well into the 2020s.

It was a good year for sub-150-seat aircraft, with ­Embraer unveiling deals for up to 300 of its E1 and E2 large regional jets, as it waits to consummate the ­marriage of its commercial business with Boeing.

Meanwhile, the erstwhile Bombardier CSeries, appearing for the first time as the Airbus A220, saw an immediate boost to its prospects with a 60-aircraft commitment from David Neeleman’s planned US start-up. It followed a tentative deal on the eve of the show for 60 A220-300s from Neeleman’s former airline JetBlue.

The agreements came as a welcome boost for two moribund product families. Despite losing the JetBlue business, Embraer’s John Slattery claimed a string of ­announcements on the second day of the show were about the Brazilian airframer “reaffirming its leadership in the space for up to 150 seats”.

At the same time, it would be churlish of a post-John Leahy-era Airbus to suggest the A220’s success at Farnborough was down to the deal-closing skills of its sales staff. However, there is no doubt Toulouse’s takeover of the programme has given potential customers belief they are buying a product that – as well as being packed with innovative technologies – will be properly supported in the aftermarket, and around for the long term.

And despite concerns that a Trump-initiated trade war could have the same effect on global trade as the US president’s favoured ketchup-laden cheeseburgers have on the arteries, those whose business it is to move goods around the world seem undeterred. A DHL Express order for 14 Boeing 777 Freighters was among several commitments for cargo transports.

This year’s show notched up deal announcements of all kinds for almost 1,500 commercial aircraft, the ­highest level since Paris 2013. Once the options, confirmations and other ifs, buts, and maybes are extracted, the “real” new orders total was down on last year’s Paris air show. But the continued strong activity is still a sign of an industry enjoying a period of stability.

For 20 years, the Q400 aircraft has helped develop new markets, connect underserved cities, and make safe, reliable air-travel possible even in the world's most remote locations

A PEOPLE CONNECTOR AND NETWORK BUILDER

Connecting people and communities is what the Q400 does best, even in some of the harshest conditions, from narrow gravel runways in frigid northern Quebec, to hot and high airports in North Africa and Asia. As a result, this aircraft plays an important role in developing economies and growing communities. It brings families together while supporting social mobility and economic independence.

Because it can serve smaller markets efficiently and cost-effectively, with enough range to bring passengers to the world's capitals; airlines have relied on the Q400 to strengthen their networks for the past two decades.

A MODERN, RELIABLE AND CONFORTABLE WORKHORSE

The Q400 aircraft has been designed as a modern, 21st-century turboprop. As the Q (for quiet) suggests, it is designed to offer passengers a safe and comfortable ride while respecting the peace of neighbouring communities. It is also a fuel-efficient aircraft, which makes it an environmentally responsible choice.

But the Q400 is also a robust and reliable workhorse, with the power to keep up with the high cycle and quick-turn demands of regional airlines. As a result, Q400 operators worldwide have achieved a dispatch reliability of 99.5 percent and schedule completion rates of 99.7 percent.

Bombardier has sold over 1,200 Q Series worldwide, with over 60 Q400 owners and operators in over 90 countries. The worldwide fleet has logged 8 million flight hours and has transported 500 million passengers to their destinations comfortably, safely and on-time.

Q400: the business-builder

Ethiopian Airlines: Growing with Africa'slargest turboprop fleet

To date, Ethiopian Airlines has purchased 34 Q400 aircraft (with 5 additional options), representing the largest and most modern turboprop fleet in Africa.

""The Q400 airliner has played a critical role in developing new markets and increasing frequencies to support improved air travel in Africa. We are committed to supporting the Single African Air Transport Market and the Q400 is a very important tool to ensure reliable, cost effective and modern air transport in the continent."" said Tewolde Gebremariam, Group Chief Executive Officer, Ethiopian Airlines. “Building on our partnerships with Asky and Malawian Airlines, we are now progressing in a partnership with Guinea Airlines, Zambia Airways and Ceiba Intercontinental (Equatorial Guinea) as well as new opportunities in Chad and we will soon launch Ethiopian Airlines Mozambique using the Q400. These markets all require a reliable fleet for their domestic and regional connections. Our core fleet of Q400s will support all these requirements as we continue to work with Bombardier to support and maintain the aircraft through our approved Q400 Authorized Service Facility and our Q400 full flight simulator,""added Mr. Gebremariam.""

Air Baltic: Q400 flying green

Operator Air Baltic touts the environmental benefits of the 12 Q400 aircraft in its fleet, saying: ""One of the greatest benefits of the aircraft is its contribution to helping preserve the environment—the Q400 uses less fuel (approximately 30 percent less than older, inefficient jets of the same size) and produces less emissions than similar aircraft."" With a range up to 2,000 kilometres these 76-seater planes help AirBaltic serve major European destinations.

SpiceJet: How the Q400 helps India's middle class take-off

SpiceJet, India placed thelargest ever order of Q400 Turboprops at the Paris Air Show in 2017—50 extra-capacity 90-seater planes—which will help deliver greater connectivity between underserved markets as the Indian middle class grows, demanding greater access to convenient flights.

""I am sure this fresh order will help us further enhance connectivity to smaller towns and cities and help realize Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of ensuring that every Indian can fly,"" said Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet.

""SpiceJet operates India's largest regional fleet and has always been a firm believer in the growth story of India's smaller towns and cities. We have worked hard over the years to put these smaller towns on the country's aviation map and will strive to keep that momentum going in the times to come.""

Philippine Airlines: Q400 brand differentiation

The Q400 has also made room for brand and service differentiation. Flag carrier, Philippine Airlines, which has been undergoing a brand refresh program, became the world's first operator of a new dual-class 86-seater Q400 last summer. At the 2017 Paris Air Show, Philippine Airlines exercised its purchase rights for seven additional units bringing its total order to twelve.

“As we position ourselves for growth, we are pleased to be adding more Q400 to our fleet to strengthen our domestic operations,"" said Jaime J. Bautista, President & Chief Operating Officer, Philippine Airlines. “We are thrilled about the opportunities that lie ahead, and we look forward to offering more capacity and improving connectivity in the region with comfortable, fast and efficient regional aircraft like Bombardier's 86-seat turboprops.""

Flying Q400 to the Future

In all of its variants, the Q400 is a turboprop ready to meet the demands of the next 20 years, with a continued commitment by Bombardier to ensure that it can meet the needs of all terrains, operating conditions and markets—large and small—reliably, efficiently and safely.

Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet is arriving in growing numbers in Europe, and is poised to play a much broader role in missile defence and other warfare plans than conventional fighters, according to U.S. and European officials.

After years of technical challenges and programme delays, the F-35, the world’s most expensive arms programme, is rapidly gaining a foothold in the United States and Europe.

The new warplane’s high-end sensors will give it a bigger role across all domains of war than previous fighter planes, including in missile defence, said General Tod Wolters, the top commander of U.S. and NATO air forces in Europe.

Norway, Britain and Italy will have received 40 F-35s in Europe by the end of the year, with the first Dutch jets to arrive next year, and the first U.S. jets in fiscal year 2021.

Israel in May became the first country to use the stealth fighter in combat.

“It’s a game-changing system,” Wolters told Reuters in an interview before the Farnborough Airshow. “We’re in the process of integrating the F-35 into the complete environment, not just the airspace.”

He said buyer countries were working “feverishly” to ensure the jets could communicate with other aircraft and the military commands in charge of operations on land, at sea and in space, to take full advantage of its capabilities.

To aid that process, the U.S. Air Force has set up a new division at its European headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, and senior officials from European user nations will also hold their annual meeting early September, U.S. Air Force officials said.

President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticised the F-35 programme for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined as production increased.

A preliminary new U.S. deal to buy 141 planes lowers the price of the F-35A, the most common version of the jet, to about $89 million, down around 6 percent from the last deal struck in February 2017, sources familiar with the talks said.

Last December, the British parliament’s Defence Committee raised questions about the procurement of the F-35 fighter jets that will eventually operate from two new aircraft carriers, criticising the Ministry of Defence for an “unacceptable lack of transparency” about the programme.

MORE THAN A FIGHTER

Wolters told an air power conference in London last week that one of the “bigger mistakes” had been to label the jet with an “F” for fighter since it offered far broader capabilities.

The jet, whose development was funded in part by Britain, will improve warnings of enemy actions and command and control functions, while beefing up air and missile defences, UK officials said at a high-level conference in London last week.

Land-based tests in 2016 showed the Aegis Combat System could kill a target using a Standard-Missile 6 with data provided solely by an F-35, with at-sea tests to follow.

Major General Tonje Skinnarland, chief of staff of the Norwegian Air Force, said she was pleased with the performance of the six F-35s received in Europe thus far, and the seven jets Norway operates for training in the United States.

She said the jets’ combination of stealth, sensors and weapons would give Norway the ability to strike from a distance, if needed, existing Russian air defence capabilities that could limit Norway’s ability to manoeuvre in its own airspace.

“Our potential adversaries have the potential to deny our operations, but the F-35 changes the game because it is able to operate in a contested environment,” she said. “It can find out what’s happening and do something about it, if necessary.”

Norway is on track to declare an initial squadron of 15 F-35s operational by October 2019, Skinnarland said, adding that integration training with the other services was well underway.

“All the European operators of the F-35 are committed to learn from each other and to move as fast as we can,” she said.",Reuters,0

"SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) played for time on its proposed new mid-sized jet at the Farnborough Airshow last week, announcing it would decide next year whether to launch its first all-new plane in a decade and giving itself 9-12 months to hone its business case.

With 225-265 seats, Boeing’s proposed new mid-sized airplane, or NMA, could fill an opening in the middle of the airplane market between the bread-and-butter single-aisle planes that dominate most fleets and the bigger long-range, twin-aisle jets.

That niche has already been partially filled by rival Airbus’ largest narrowbody, the bestselling A321neo. But Boeing insists the NMA would be able to open new routes due to longer range and superior economics, just as its 787 revamped long-haul travel by connecting secondary cities.

Capacity and range are not the only factors Boeing is considering as it makes one of its most significant decisions in years.

To make business sense, the price must be low enough to lure airlines and high enough to leave a return for Boeing, while squeezing through a narrow economic gap in prices between single-aisle and twin-aisle planes. A key question is whether the gap is wide enough to take the plunge.

“That is the challenge of the NMA,” John Plueger, chief executive of Air Lease Corp, told Reuters.

“Building a business case in 2018 for an airplane that won’t start in service until 2025 is not such an easy slam dunk.”

Planemakers do not publish the real prices at which they sell their jets, which include significant discounts, but most analysts say the net price of the new jet would come in at $60-$70 million – about $15-20 million more than a discounted single-aisle jet.

While Boeing’s focus is on cutting costs, company officials have poured cold water on speculation that it could revert to a cheaper metal fuselage rather than weight-saving modern composites.

“They have got to get it right. It is a tough needle to thread,” Plueger said.

Boeing does have a potential wild card.

While the business case is being studied on its own merits, the time frame for a decision – 2019 – coincides with the expected closing of a deal for Boeing to take over Embraer’s (EMBR3.SA) commercial operations.

Embraer would give Boeing access to extra engineering resources and R&D capacity at a lower cost.

“It gives us additional opportunities to consider,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters, when asked whether the Embraer acquisition might inject extra clarity into the NMA decision.

Embraer has some “very effective, streamlined” development processes, Muilenburg added.

“When we’re able to complete this deal it would give us another option, another set of resources, additional ideas and that could be helpful to the (NMA) business case,” he said. “It’s another factor that can be considered in the overall business case.”

Boeing officials said the business case was already improving on a standalone basis.

Still, a significant hurdle remains: the capacity and willingness of engine makers to produce the right engine in the correct time frame. This has become the main “pacing factor” in the NMA decision, a person familiar with the plans said.

Boeing, which has conducted wind tunnel trials as it studies the NMA, has done more pre-development work than usual to avoid a repeat of industrial problems both in-house and at suppliers which delayed the 787, people close to the matter said.

Recent industrial problems among engine makers could tip Boeing towards offering airlines a choice of two engines, but this would force each supplier to make do with a smaller slice of the new business.

“There is a strategic rationale for dual sources: it mitigates technology risks. But the business case for the engine guy becomes very thin,” said Domhnal Slattery, CEO of leasing company Avolon.",Reuters,0
"FAIRFORD, England (Reuters) - Richard Komurek has travelled the world with the U.S. Air Force, but his deployment to a British air show this month provided a poignant homecoming to the English town where his mother was born to Polish refugees after World War Two.

After accompanying a senior U.S. Air Force general to the world’s largest military air show in the town of Fairford, Komurek, 49, visited the site of the Polish resettlement camp where his mother, Mary, was born in 1949.

His grandparents, Tadeusz Tarach and Anna Kuszczak, both Polish forced labourers in Germany under the Nazis, fled to England after the war, where they met at the camp, got married and had two children before moving to the United States in 1951.

“The people in my family are extremely grateful to the British for giving them refuge in those dire times,” Komurek said, adding that he felt great warmth from locals who shared their experiences with the post-war Polish camps in Britain.

“People have been so friendly,” he said. After hearing his story on local radio, one woman wrote to tell him she was born at the same camp in southwest England as his mother.

She sent him a photograph of a commemorative plaque at the site, which housed 1,500 Poles who had been deported to labour camps in Siberia or Germany.

Komurek’s heart-warming experience stands in contrast to the emotive debate over the roughly 800,000 Poles who now live in Britain and frustration over record high immigration rates that triggered Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.

The U.S. Air Force officer said his visit to Fairford - which each year attracts senior military officials and industry executives - made him feel more connected to his family history, and strengthened his sense of being both a proud American and a global citizen.

“It’s just a kind of chance where my family ended up,” he said. “Because of history, I could have been Polish, I could have been British, or even Canadian.”

Komurek grew up in Arizona and worked as a journalist for several years before he joined the Air Force - a career that has taken him to places as far-flung as South Korea, Honduras, the Netherlands and Germany.

He thinks Polish refugees after World War Two may have had an easier time than modern day refugees given the shared war experiences.

“After the war, when everyone had suffered, people were less threatened by people coming. Maybe now ... it’s hard for people to find empathy because it’s not a shared suffering. They can’t comprehend what it’s like to be a war refugee if they haven’t experienced war themselves.”",Reuters,0
"Increasing cost pressures in the defence market and another major financial charge on the KC-46A tanker programme eroded Boeing’s financial performance in an otherwise healthy second quarter.

Operating margins for the Commercial Airplanes division increased 2.4 percentage points to 11.4% compared to last year on 1% sales growth over the same period. Overall, Boeing’s sales grew 5% year-over-year in the second quarter, while net earnings leaped 26% to $2.2 billion. Operating margin across the company inched forward to 11.2%.

The commercial and services markets performed as expected, but Boeing lowered guidance on operating margins for the Defense, Space and Security division. The operating margin for the full year is now expected to range between 10-10.5% for BDS, versus a previous forecast of 11%.

Moreover, a recurring management problem on the KC-46A re-appeared in the second quarter. Boeing reported new pre-tax charges related to the new US Air Force tanker amounting to $426 million, adding to more than $3 billion of previous charges logged over the course of the seven-year-old development programme.

Those two disclosures combined to force Boeing’s share price to dip slightly in morning trading, albeit from near a historic peak of $358 per share when the market opened on 25 January.

But Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg remains upbeat on the Boeing’s performance in the second quarter.

After inducting the first two test aircraft into a low-rate initial production line, the 777X programme remains on track for first flight next year, with GE Aviation’s GE9X engines behind schedule but still promised to be available when called for.

Muilenburg’s commercial sales chief, Ihsanne Mounir, has helped filled a once-gaping hole in the production schedule for the current 777 assembly line, with 29 new orders booked so far this year and 29 more committed to by Volga-Dnepr at the Farnborough air show last week. Mounir still “has more work to do” to complete the“skyline” of 777 production slots through the bridge to the new model, Muilenburg says, but the pressure is down.

Boeing’s manufacturing operations for single-aisle aircraft also showed no signs of slowing. Production rates for the 737 family increased to 52 per month in June, another increase on a line headed to 57 per month next year and perhaps more in 2020. Meanwhile, Boeing delivered 52 re-engined 737 Max aircraft in the second quarter.

The long shadow cast by the KC-46A’s development troubles also may finally be coming to an end. The latest charge covers the cost of modifying test and production aircraft to the final delivery configuration. Boeing completed all flight tests required for first delivery in the second quarter, and the hand-over for the first aircraft is planned for October. The USAF plans to buy 179 KC-46As with an estimated contract value of $30 billion.

Boeing’s position on the status of the proposed New Mid-Market Airplane (NMA) remained unchanged after the second quarter earnings call. A decision on whether to launch 200-270-seat family of aircraft with 4,000-5,000nm range is expected in 2019, with an entry-in-service targeted for six years later, Muilenburg says. The company is still working to “close the business case” for the NMA, which faces the challenge of delivering a widebody travel experience with narrowbody economics.

“That’s frankly the challenge of closing the business case,” Muilenburg says.",Flight Global,0

"(Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) on Wednesday posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue but shares dropped as much as 3.6 percent after it reported $426 million in higher costs on its long-delayed KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program.

Analysts worry that the world’s largest planemaker’s exposure to an escalating trade fight between Washington and Beijing as well as mounting costs on the tanker program will slow Boeing shares, up more than 21 percent year to date.

“The KC-46 has returned to again haunt Boeing’s results,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said in a research note.

“Management has previously expressed confidence that there would be no more tanker charges, and yet they keep coming,” Stallard said, adding that the higher tanker costs came with unchanged earnings and cash flow forecasts.

Chicago-based Boeing said the KC-46 program cost an additional $426 million before taxes in the quarter as the company worked through test delays and production changes to eight aircraft in various stages of production.

Boeing has amassed roughly $3 billion in costs on the program, a derivative of its 767 commercial aircraft, as it works to deliver tankers to the Air Force in October - more than two years behind schedule.

Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts on a post-earnings conference call that plans to complete manufacturing on the tankers was “clear, and firmed up.”

Muilenburg also said he was not surprised by the unusually high number of plane orders announced during last week’s Farnborough Airshow with unnamed buyers. Rival Airbus (AIR.PA) said the firms did not want to be identified due to jitters about appearing to side with the United States or other economic powers amid heated trade rhetoric.

“I don’t find it (the anonymity) surprising one way or the other,” Muilenburg said, adding that Chinese demand for Boeing aircraft extends far beyond a single air show.

“As we think about the China-U.S trade relationships, aerospace is something that is good for both countries,” Muilenburg said. “It creates growth capacity in China. It’s helping to grow their economy. It’s growing jobs in China. And as China grows, it’s growing jobs in the U.S.”

Despite the KC-46 problems, Boeing beat expectations on quarterly profit. Core earnings, which exclude some pension costs, were $3.33 per share, while the average analyst estimate was $3.26, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Overall revenue rose 5 percent to $24.26 billion, also topping estimates, while commercial aircraft deliveries increased by 6 percent to 194 aircraft. Boeing booked 239 net orders during the quarter, including 91 wide-body jets.

For the full year, the company expects total revenue of $97 billion to $99 billion, compared with its previous estimate of $96 billion to $98 billion.

Boeing also forecast a 2018 operating margin of 10 percent to 10.5 percent in its defense business, down from its previous outlook of roughly 11 percent, and did not change its 2018 core earnings outlook of $14.30 to $14.50 per share.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - The top U.S. Air Force general in Europe on Wednesday said it was critical to ensure any future British fighter jet was compatible with the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin for a number of U.S. allies, including Britain.

General Tod Wolters, commander of U.S. and NATO air forces in Europe, told reporters on a teleconference that he had watched Britain’s unveiling of a new fighter jet development effort electronically from afar, but had not spoken with UK officials specifically about the new combat aircraft programme.

UK officials launched the new Tempest fighter jet programme last week at the Farnborough Airshow outside London.

Wolters said officials from both countries had discussed future combat air capabilities in the past, and agreed on the need to ensure any new systems could work with existing weapons.

“One of the key ingredients that has to go into any future systems is to make sure that it’s interoperable with existing systems and certainly the systems that UK is embracing,” he said, referring to Britain’s growing fleet of F-35 fighter jets.

“As the UK decides to go forward with a system that could be called Tempest, we would hope that it would be as interoperable as possible with the great system that they’ve just acquired ... the F-35B,” he said.

CERTAIN

He said he was certain that Britain was looking very closely at the issue, which he called “critical”.

Britain has said it is looking for international partners for the new development programme, and is already in discussions with Sweden, Japan and other countries. Wolters sidestepped a question on whether the United States could also play a role.

He did announce plans to bring U.S. radar-evading, or fifth-generation, aircraft to Europe in the coming months to continue efforts to integrate those capabilities with fifth-generation aircraft operated by allies, and with older fourth-generation weapons in Europe.

He declined to provide details on whether the F-35 or F-22, both radar-evading aircraft, would be brought to Europe, or when.

The deployment would also help U.S. and allied officials hone planning for potential future wars, including the ability to detect enemy strikes, and to command and control military forces, he said.

"Indian low-cost carrier IndiGo has again temporarily grounded some Airbus A320neos as it awaits spare Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines.

The carrier's parent company InterGlobe Aviation states in a stock exchange disclosure that ""as part of our normal maintenance schedule, a few A320neos have been taken out of service.""

""We are currently waiting for spare engines from Pratt and Whitney, for which the release process has already been initiated by them. These aircraft are expected to be back in service in the second half of August, 2018,"" it adds.

IndiGo would not clarify many aircraft are out-of-service when contacted by FlightGlobal. Local media reports say that five of the A320neos are grounded at present.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that IndiGo operates 39 A320neos within its fleet of 171 A320s, with a further 391 of the type on order.

The carrier has had to ground a number of A320neos over the past two years due to issues with the PW1100G engines. In March, India's Director General of Civil Aviation ordered the grounding of eight IndiGo A320s, as well as three from GoAir, following aborted take-offs and in-flight shutdowns.

A knife edge seal issue was discovered in January which was traced to a design change introduced last year. That was intended to rectify earlier problems with the engine, but made it worse.

P&W chief executive Bob Leduc previously said the engine’s original knife edge seal was delivered with a design flaw that required an inspection after a certain interval of flight hours.

P&W has since resumed shipments of PW1100Gs to Airbus with a previous design of a knife edge seal that does not have the flaw.

The engine manufacturer told FlightGlobal last month that it expects to rectify issues with the knife edge seals on the in-service fleet of PW1100G geared turbofan engines by the middle of 2019.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus is crediting the A350 programme and the gradual recovery of A320neo deliveries for a strong second quarter, in which commercial aircraft adjusted earnings more than doubled to €908 million ($1.06 billion).

But the airframer warns that “risks remain” to meet the “challenging” delivery target of 800 aircraft this year – a figure which does not include the newly-acquired A220 programme, with which Airbus is separately aiming to reach 18 deliveries in the second half.

Commercial aircraft revenues were up by 13% in the second quarter but only 2%, to €18.5 billion, over the first half.

Chief executive Tom Enders says the first-half financial results reflect the combination of drag from the A320neo troubles over the first few months combined with a “strong improvement” on the A350 programme.

“A320neo aircraft deliveries picked up during the second quarter but challenges remain to meet our full-year targets,” he says.

But he points out that more A320neos than A320s were delivered during the second quarter, illustrating that the re-engined single-aisle production effort is gaining momentum.

“Our operational focus in commercial aircraft remains squarely on securing the production ramp-up,” adds Enders.

Commercial aircraft adjusted earnings for the first half rose to €867 million from the previous interim level of €257 million.

“Engine manufacturers are working to meet their commitments and resources and capabilities have been mobilised internally,” says Airbus, reiterating that the number of parked engineless A320neos is continuing to decline.

A350 deliveries over the first half included the first -1000s, handed over to Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific.

Airbus says “good progress” has been made on A350 recurring costs as the programme edges towards its year-end production target of 10 aircraft per month. “The A350’s industrial system is now reaching a mature level with the focus remaining on recurring cost convergence,” it adds.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus believes there is sufficient demand in the market to support a potential A220 ramp-up at least to 100 aircraft per year.

The airframer is aiming to deliver 18 of the twinjets over the second half of this year, following its acquisition of the former Bombardier CSeries programme.

But speaking during a half-year briefing, Airbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm said there was “clearly” potential to take annual production to 100 aircraft and beyond – although he stopped short of forecasting when such output might be achieved.

Chief executive Tom Enders supported this outlook, declaring that there was “no doubt” that the A220 would be a “great success story”.

He points out that the “unanimous” customer feedback on the aircraft was one of the factors which convinced Airbus to proceed with the programme acquisition.

“This aircraft is over-performing against what the manufacturer committed to,” says Enders, adding that it is capable of capturing half of the market demand with Airbus’s backing.

The airframer has yet to determine how the production rates will be split between the Mirabel line and the planned new assembly facility in Mobile from 2020.

“We know the US market is the single largest market for this type of aircraft,” says Enders. “We know we can ramp this up further. There are a lot of variables in this equation but they all point in a positive direction.”

Airbus is introducing the A220 as part of its single-aisle line.

Deliveries of its own A319, which competes in the 130-seat sector, have declined over the past decade. It produced 105 A319s in 2007 and 98 the following year, but output has dwindled with a total of just 40 aircraft leaving the assembly line since the beginning of 2015.",Flight Global,0
"Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson established the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office as a two-year test programme to reduce sustainment costs of the service’s aging aircraft fleet.

The new office was announced on 25 July and is focused on rapid sustainment processes that could significantly drive down costs and deliver faster solutions to the field, the USAF says. If the office demonstrates positive return on investment over time the service says it will consider making the office permanent.

“We will no longer pay premiums for things we can manufacture on our own,” Wilson says. “We will leverage agile manufacturing and reform legacy sustainment processes to drive down costs and at meet warfighter needs rapidly.”

Focus areas for the rapid sustainment office include predictive maintenance and agile manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and cold spray repair technologies. Other focus areas include robotics and automation, corrosion detection and repair, nondestructive inspection and advanced composite repair technologies.

Ideas for solving aircraft sustainment problems at a lower cost that come out of the Rapid Sustainment Office will be given higher priority by the USAF, and will be quickly tried and spread across the service.

Runaway sustainment costs have been a long term headache for the USAF. For example, aircraft operating and support costs grew at an average rate of 6.5% per year between fiscal years 1996 and 2011 despite a reduction of more than 1,000 aircraft in the Air Force fleet and minimal increases in total flying activity, according to a report by RAND.

And, an internal analysis by the USAF reportedly said in March 2018 that if the service does not reduce overall operating and support costs of the F-35 by as much as 38% over a decade, it would have to reduce its purchases of the aircraft from Lockheed Martin by one-third. Such a measure would eliminate 590 of the stealth fighters from the 1,763 the USAF planned to order.",Flight Global,0
"Bombardier’s UK facility in Belfast will receive local government funding worth nearly £12 million ($15.8 million) to develop thrust-reversers for an Airbus A320neo nacelle.

The UK Treasury says that the funding will ""help the company secure long-term manufacturing jobs in Belfast"" and ""cement the UK’s role as a leading manufacturer of high-tech aircraft components"".

Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed the effort during a visit to Bombardier’s Short Brothers subsidiary in Belfast on 25 July. He told UK broadcaster ITV that the funding is about ""the future of Bombardier"", and represents ""the British government's support for Bombardier"".

Part of the financial support will be provided by regional development agency Invest Northern Ireland.

Bombardier disclosed late last year that its Aerostructures and Engineering Services division had won a contract from Airbus to produce thrust-reversers for nacelles of Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered A320neos.

Airbus is developing the equipment in competition against current geared-turbofan nacelle producer United Technologies.

At the Belfast site, Bombardier also produces wings for the A220 programme, over which Airbus took control earlier this month.

"Embraer is conducting an African tour with its re-engined 190-E2 model, including demonstration flights for key E-Jet customer Kenya Airways.

The twinjet (PR-ZGQ) had been displayed at the Farnborough air show in mid-July but subsequently flew to Algiers and Casablanca – the bases of Air Algerie and Royal Air Maroc.

RAM is already using Embraer E-Jets as part of its fleet.

The E2 demonstrator then flew via Accra – the home of another Embraer operator, Africa World Airlines, which uses ERJ-145s – to Nairobi.

It performed a demonstration flight over the volcano Kilimanjaro for Kenya Airways, which has a fleet of 15 Embraer 190s.

As the largest E-Jet operator in Africa, Kenya Airways highlighted the E2’s arrival with a high-profile event attended by Brazil’s ambassador to Kenya, Fernando Coimbra.

Coimbra described the aircraft’s trip as a “landmark moment” for the Brazilian co-operation with the airline.

"Airbus's repackaging of its global market forecast into a series of categories more akin to a clothing store is a response to the blurring of lines between range and aircraft size.

Single-aisle aircraft are no longer restricted to plying short-haul routes. Twin-aisles, with their higher capacity, need not be crossing oceans but might instead serve as a shuttle on routes that were once classified as regional.

Never mind that Airbus's rejig conveniently allows the A350-1000 to distract from weak A380 sales in the large-aircraft sector.

The more interesting consequence is the combination of the A321neo and A330neo in the medium-size category: a combination that encapsulates the European company's attempt to orchestrate a pincer movement on Boeing's New Mid-market Airplane.

Airbus

Airbus views the NMA as a solution looking for a problem. The NMA is intended to slot into the gap between single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft, taking the performance, capability and cost advantages of both sectors and bringing them together in a single design.

But the gap, Airbus believes, is vanishingly small, a figment of fevered imaginations in Seattle. A single/twin partnership between the long-range A321LR and the A330neo offers a simple bridge, with no need for a hybrid, it says. Nearly 50 customers, it points out, already operate both A321s and A330s.

Boeing's strategy relies on demonstrating that there is, indeed, a problem. Airbus has struggled in the 250-seat sector, abandoning the A350-800 and hoping to replicate the A320neo's popularity by re-engining the A330.

The US airframer wants to test Airbus's vulnerability and assess whether an all-new aircraft can wedge itself firmly between two revamped, but ultimately older, designs. And whether it would sit comfortably – and commonly – with its own 250-seat 787, on one hand, and its re-engined 737 Max on the other.

The A330-800 has yet to prove that it can find a market, especially given that advances in design have lessened the influence of range capability since the early years of the A330 programme. Airbus is putting its faith in the loyalty and satisfaction of older A330 operators.

It might yet tighten the mid-market pincer from below, with a further tweak of its A321LR. But putting its refreshed single- and twin-aisle jets on the same page of a forecast, and close together on a family diagram, is easy. Championing from AirAsia notwithstanding, translating them into sales while its rival plots a new, tailored product, will be considerably harder.",Flight Global,1

"Embraer has delayed the entry into service of the KC-390 with the Brazilian air force to 2019, after a runway excursion in May pushed the airframer to a $17.7 million operating loss in the second quarter.

While Embraer is still committed to delivering the first production KC-390, aircraft 003, to Brazil by year-end, it says the air force has agreed to make the aircraft available so that the manufacturer can use it, along with aircraft 002, to complete the flight-test campaign.

Entry into service will take place in 2019 – pushed back from late 2018 – with the delivery of aircraft 004, the second production KC-390. Subsequent delivery dates are not impacted, says Embraer.

The changes to the flight-test campaign will result in a one-time special charge of $127 million, impacting Embraer's second-quarter results. The airframer had reported a $178 million operating profit in the second quarter of 2017.

Revenue was down 29% at $1.26 billion on lower deliveries of commercial and executive jets as well as cost-base revisions related to the KC-390 development contract. These resulted from the May accident involving aircraft 001.

Embraer sustained a net loss attributable to shareholders of $127 million in the quarter, falling into the red after a net profit of $62 million in the corresponding period of 2017.

Excluding the special charge related to the KC-390, Embraer would have reported an adjusted operating profit of $110 million and adjusted net profit of $6.1 million, it says.

The airframer delivered 28 commercial and 20 executive jets in the second quarter, including the first three E190-E2s to Norway's Wideroe. Delivery numbers were down from the 35 commercial and 24 executive jets handed over in the second quarter of 2017.

Embraer's firm order backlog stood at $17.4 billion at the end of 2018's second quarter, down from $19.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. An order for 50 E-Jet E2s from now-defunct Indian carrier Air Costa was removed from the backlog in the second quarter.",Flight Global,0

"Rolls-Royce has taken a £554 million ($725 million) exceptional charge in its first half, to account for the costs incurred to address blade problems with its Trent 1000 engines for the Boeing 787.

The company has disclosed the charge as it clarified expected cash costs next year relating to issues affecting both the Trent 1000 and the Airbus A380’s Trent 900 powerplants.

Rolls-Royce states that the £554 million charge amounts to some 40% of the total cash cost it expects to shoulder in the period to 2022 as it resolves the Trent 1000 situation.

It says the charge reflects the “impact of the abnormal costs” it is incurring, which fall outside of normal costs for its TotalCare maintenance and support scheme.

The charge will cover costs such as responding to customer claims relating to operational disruption, as well as wastage costs linked to shop visits.

Rolls-Royce adds that the remainder of the costs will be recognised “over time” through its regular contract-accounting margins.

The manufacturer estimates that the combined cash cost of dealing with in-service issues on the Trent 1000 as well as the Trent 900 will reach a “similar level” in 2019 to the £450 million it has previously forecast for 2018.

These cash costs will then decline, it says, by “at least” £100 million in 2020, after which they will “step down materially” as the technical changes to the engines are fully introduced by 2022.

“We still expect to deliver an improvement in 2019 underlying core free cash flow compared to our guidance for 2018, marking a further step towards our 2020 free cash flow ambition,” says the company.

Rolls-Royce reiterates its acknowledgement that the problems with the Trent 1000 have caused “significant” disruption for several customers.

It has commenced certification testing of a redesigned intermediate compressor rotor blade for the Package C version of the engine, and a redesign for Package B engines will follow. It is also testing a revised blade for the Trent 1000 TEN and Trent 7000 engines – for the 787 and Airbus A330neo respectively – as a precaution.",Flight Global,0

"Rolls-Royce increased the rotor tip clearances between the engine casing and intermediate pressure compressor ( IPC) blades across various stages of newly manufactured Trent 700 powerplants, following an in-flight power loss on a Singapore Airlines Airbus A330-300 on 23 May 2015.

The modification was revealed in a final report by Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau on the incident.

The aircraft, bearing registration 9V-SSF, was operating enroute to Shanghai from Singapore when the incident occurred at 12:56 local time, as it encountered an area of adverse weather.

The TSIB found the flight crew received a message on the aircraft’s Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring system (ECAM) display indicating that the aircraft’s right engine had surged. Before they took action, the right engine self-recovered from the surge, but the ECAM message was replaced by another message indicating that the left engine had surged.

The flight crew declared a mayday and shut down the left hand engine, before descending to a cruise level of 26,000ft. After discussing diversion options, the crew decided that it would be better to continue to Shanghai to avoid going through more weather cells.

They subsequently were able to restart the left engine and continued to its destination with both engines running normally, and cancelled the mayday. There were no injuries to the 192 passengers and crew on-board.

Analysis of the aircraft's flight data recorder showed that over 12 seconds the right engine surged three times and the left twice. No damage or faults were found, however, when inspections were carried out on the engines at Shanghai, and the aircraft was cleared to return to Singapore.

Upon its return, the left engine was removed and disassembled, which revealed signs of heavy rubbing of the rotor path abradable lining at Stages 3 and 6 of the IPC . Some IPC blades also had grey dust deposits of aluminium and silicon, which were consistent with the materials in the lining.

A thermal analysis by R-R found that during weather conditions experienced in the flight, the engine casing may have contracted as a result of water droplets or ice crystals being centrigued out of the IPC, bringing the lining into contact with the IPC blades and causing some of the material to separate.

The TSIB believes that those separated pieces of l ining entered the combustion section and ignited, causing a temporary disruption of airflow through the engine and the rapid surges.

R-R subsequently increased the clearance between the IPC blades and the engine casing. SIA also implemented a policy of not pairing new engines together on its A330 fleet, to avoid the likelihood of twp new engines encountering the same issue.",Flight Global,0
"Italian aerospace group Leonardo is negotiating with Airbus to secure new terms for the supply of A220 components.

Leonardo chief executive Alessandro Profumo said during a results briefing on 30 July that the group had initiated legal proceedings against Bombardier before Airbus took over control of the A220 programme – previously known as the CSeries – in July, and that the case had now been redirected at the European airframer.

Having previously admitted that Leonardo was ""losing money"" on the programme, Profumo says the price the manufacturer receives for A220 components is below a ""cost structure discussed with Bombardier"".

Leonardo supplies the vertical and horizontal stabilisers for the A220.

Profumo is hopeful that the dispute can be resolved. ""We have a very open talk on that with our Airbus friends,"" he says.

"Rolls-Royce has acknowledged a level of uncertainty surrounding the in-service issues of its Trent 1000 engine, and indicated that the situation will remain ""dynamic"" until at least next year.

Until the engine's long-term performance can be assessed during ""sustained periods"" between scheduled overhauls, the UK manufacturer ""cannot guarantee"" that no potential further technical issues will be discovered, chief executive Warren East said during a results briefing today.

East says the ""identified issues"" with the Boeing 787-powering engine – these centred on durability of compressor and turbine blades – were discovered in 2016-17.

While problems with intermediate-pressure turbine blades on Trent 1000 Package B and C engines have been ""pretty much"" resolved with the introduction of a redesigned component, subsequently disclosed issues with IP compressor blades were ""not completely understood"" until the first quarter of 2018, East concedes.

""We were learning what the issues were,"" he says.

But as ""manifestation"" of the IP compressor blade problem has ""not evolved"" since late 2017, he is confident that the manufacturer's ongoing efforts to introduce a redesigned IP compressor blade will resolve the issue.

Nevertheless, East foresees a ""dynamic situation"" over the next 12-18 months.

Meanwhile, R-R is working with affected 787 operators ""almost on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis"" to limit disruption.

"United Airlines is finalising plans to open a Boeing 787 pilot base at its Newark Liberty hub, a precursor to beginning Dreamliner flying from the airport in 2019.

The Chicago-based carrier will open 787 positions at Newark for pilots to bid on beginning in September, says United managing director of crew resources Paul Carlson in a newsletter to pilots on 1 August. More details on operations from Newark, including which aircraft variants and what routes they will fly, will be forthcoming later in August, he says.

“We are evaluating using the 787 flying out of Newark in the future and are in the early stages of planning for that by ensuring we have proper pilot staffing allocated at the right time,"" says United on the newsletter, adding that details have not been finalised.

Carlson previously told pilots in May that United was considering opening a 787 base at Newark around April 2019, with an eye on placing its new 787-10s there.

""I am unable to provide specific EWR 787 mission details; but for now, note that the 787-10 is well-suited for European destinations,"" he said at the time.

United will take delivery of its first three of 14 787-10s later this year, with plans to place them in service in early 2019. The aircraft will be configured with 318 seats, including 41 Polaris business, 21 premium economy, 45 extra-legroom economy and 208 economy.

The airline operates 12 787-8s and 25 787-9s, and has four more -9s on order in addition to the -10s, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.

The 787-10 is widely viewed as a good aircraft for higher-density routes where airlines do not need the additional range of either of the smaller Dreamliner variants but seek improved economics.

""The 787-10 represents our largest variant, it simply sets the bar as the most efficient twin-aisle in its class on a cost per seat mile basis,"" said Kevin McCallister, president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, at the delivery of the first 787-10 to Singapore Airlines in March.

The aircraft are also popular with customers for a variety of reasons, including their larger windows and lower cabin pressure that is understood to reduce the impact of jetlag.

United flies its 787s on a range of medium- to ultra-long-haul routes from its Denver, Houston Intercontinental, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington Dulles hubs. The aircraft allowed the airline to launch one of the world's longest nonstop flights to Singapore from San Francisco, while also performing well on transatlantic routes like Paris to Washington Dulles.

"Four Brazilian lawmakers have petitioned the federal court to stop Embraer from forming two proposed joint ventures with Boeing. Embraer dismisses the attempt by the Workers Party members as a ""natural"" reaction to its proposed transactions – but not a barrier to completing the deals.

The substance of the four politicians' objections to Embraer's moves is inaccurate, bordering on paranoid. But some details of their complaint raise valid issues and highlight the difficulties that lie ahead if the deals are to be approved by year-end.

On 5 July, the companies announced the agreement under which Boeing is to acquire 80% of Embraer's commercial aircraft division for $3.8 billion. They are also discussing a separate joint venture focused on the Brazilian manufacturer's defence products, especially the KC-390 transport/tanker.

Customers seem to have embraced the deal. In an era of increasingly powerful tier-one suppliers, Embraer's ability to lower the costs of producing a new family of re-engined regional jets is limited without the market leverage offered by Boeing. With its only competitor – the former Bombardier CSeries – now being sold as the Airbus A220 family, the upper range of products from Embraer's commercial division faces annihilation.

If those are the most obvious reasons for completing the deal, there remain significant questions about how such a partnership will work. How will Embraer keep its 4,000-strong engineering workforce intact? What is the fate of its executive-jets business, which is excluded from the acquisition proposals? What is the scope of Boeing's role regarding the proposed defence joint ­venture – and how would it protect the Brazilian government's ability to preserve its sovereignty over homegrown military technology?

The lawmakers are right to demand answers to these questions before allowing either deal to be approved. Embraer, though privatised since 1994, is a creation of the Brazilian government, possessing technology and skills that are of great value to the whole country. Such a transaction should face intense public scrutiny.

In other matters, the opposition is less reasonable. In a video posted on Facebook, politician Carlos Zarattini theorised that the deals were a ploy by Boeing and the US government to appropriate the technology and skills of a rising industrial and strategic competitor. But despite impressive strides over the last two decades, Embraer's annual revenues of less than $6 billion are no threat to Boeing's near-$100 billion sales total.",Flight Global,0
"Iran Air is receiving a batch of five ATR 72-600s on 5 August, in a bid to beat a renewed US government sanctions deadline which would block delivery of the turboprops.

The five aircraft departed Toulouse as a group around 20:00 on 4 August, heading for Tehran Mehrabad airport via Urmia.

Iran’s transport ministry states that the aircraft are due to arrive on the morning of 14 Mordad, in the Iranian calendar, equating to 5 August.

It lists the five turboprops as bearing successive registrations EP-ITI, -ITJ, -ITK, -ITL and –ITM.

ATR had already delivered eight of the type to the Iranian flag-carrier, out of a total firm order for 20 which was finally concluded with the airline around April last year.

But the airframer had been pessimistic about the possibility of handing over any more, given US president Donald Trump’s decision to abandon a nuclear-related agreement which had eased sanctions and allowed Iran Air to commence a fleet modernisation.

The renewed sanctions have been due to take effect from 6 August, the end of a 90-day wind-down period.

Iran’s transport ministry says the French authorities had sought US approval to deliver the additional ATRs and that they will take the total number of new aircraft in the Iran Air fleet to 16, comprising 13 ATR 72-600s, two Airbus A330-200s and an A321.",Flight Global,0

"Regional turboprop manufacturer ATR is still examining the potential implications of the European Union’s response to newly-imposed US government sanctions on Iran.

The European Union introduced an updated version of its blocking statute on 7 August, as the US government reversed its easing of nuclear-related sanctions – an easing which had enabled Iran Air and other Iranian carriers to place aircraft orders with US and European airframers.

Intended to counter the effects of sanctions on EU firms, the blocking statute amounts to a unified EU response to extra-territorial legislation from third countries, and forbids EU companies from complying with extra-territorial legislation unless authorised by the European Commission.

But the realistic effects on the aerospace sector have yet to become clear.

Airbus has not delivered any aircraft to Iran Air for about a year and a half, but ATR transferred a batch of turboprops just as the sanctions deadline approached.

ATR says it is “studying” the “possible impacts” of the EU legislation, but adds: “It is too early to say something.”

US president Donald Trump warned, as the new sanctions took effect, that “anyone doing business with Iran will not be doing business with the USA”.

This suggests that, even if Airbus and ATR could find legal channels through which to deliver aircraft, they would risk being restricted in the US market – which is far more lucrative than Iran’s.

In early June the ministers of European states which were still committed to the Iranian nuclear deal asked the US Treasury and Department of State to grant exemptions “to allow for economic relationships in key sectors” – specifically identifying civil aviation as one of them.

"Mexican carrier Interjet received Ps733 million ($39.6 million) in compensation for maintenance costs for its Sukhoi Superjet 100 fleet, after the airline was forced to ground at least four SSJ100s in the past year or so.

The airline says the amount, recorded in its second quarter financial results, is an estimate of contractual recovery of the costs related to maintenance of its SSJ100s.

Interjet recorded maintenance-related expenses of Ps652 million in the second quarter, as part of overall operating expenses that rose 21% in the period to Ps6.18 billion. It notes that the compensation of Ps733 million had helped offset its expenses.

The airline did not respond to queries from FlightGlobal. Sukhoi and Superjet International did not respond.

A report by Bloomberg earlier this year said that Interjet had grounded four SSJ100s and was cannibalising the aircraft for parts to keep its remaining SSJ100 fleet in service. Superjet International subsequently played this down, with its senior vice-president of commercial Stewart Cordner telling FlightGlobal in January: ""Temporary robbing of parts isn't cannibalism.""

Interjet currently has a fleet of 22 SSJ100s, one of which is still in storage, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows. That lone aircraft, XA-PBA, sustained significant damage to its nose after an accident involving an air bridge at Mexico City airport in 2015. Delivered to Interjet in April 2014, the aircraft has spent about 65% of its lifetime in storage.

The grounding reported earlier this year followed weeks-long repairs in early 2017 to 11 of Interjet's SSJ100s, after defects were found on the aircraft's stabiliser nodes.

Despite the compensation for maintenance costs, the impact of higher fuel prices pushed Interjet to an operating loss of Ps395 million in the second quarter. Revenue rose 9.6% to Ps5.78 billion. The airline reported a net loss of Ps142 million in the second quarter, reversing from a net profit of Ps114 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017.

"Levels of carbon dioxide in airliner cockpits can be high enough that in simulations it causes pilots to fail test manoeuvres at higher rates than normal, a new Harvard University study has found.

The first-of-its-kind research suggests that current regulations aren’t adequate to assure there’s enough fresh air in airline flight decks and raises questions about whether even moderately elevated carbon dioxide levels could impact safety, said Joseph Allen, an assistant professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health and lead author of the study.

“It’s clear that the air quality in the cockpit can have an impact on performance,” Allen said. “It’s clear we haven’t been thinking about it too deeply in terms of the impact on pilot performance. Now that we know, I think we’re obligated to ask those next sets of questions and really understand it.”

In recent years, studies have shown that even an increase of a few hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air we breath causes people to test lower for cognitive skills. But until the latest study, pilots and airline cockpits hadn’t been examined.

"Hypersonic passenger travel still seems more like dreamy work of science fiction than a feasible commercial project, but this is now a fact: Boeing is working on it, and it’s a serious project.

“It may not be as hard as people think it is,” says Boeing chief technology officer Greg Hyslop, who quickly adds a caveat: “It’s still going to be hard.”

Boeing first unveiled its hypersonic airliner concept on 26 June at an aviation technology conference and highlighted it again at the Farnborough air show in July.

In an industry that has lacked a supersonic transport option since 2003, suddenly proposing a hypersonic airliner as a viable option within 20-30 years seems to register somewhere between the ambitious and the absurd.

But Boeing insists that it has found a combination of speed, materials and propulsion that can make a Mach 5-capable aircraft not only technologically achievable, but financially profitable at some point after around 2040.

They even think they have worked out a solution for one of the trickiest problems associated with hypersonic flight. To cruise at speeds around M5.0, the aircraft has to fly at an altitude between 90,000 and 95,000 feet. The passengers won’t be wearing space suits, so they’ll be seated in a pressurised cabin. So any event that causes a depressurisation at that altitude would be catastrophic.

“We’re aware of it, and we’d thought about it,” says Kevin Bowcutt, a Boeing senior technical fellow and chief scientist for hypersonics.

“And we have some very innovative approaches for dealing with it,” he adds. “Basically, we’ve devised a concept that would keep the cabin pressurised even in a depressurisation event.”

Bowcutt declines to elaborate further on the technical solution to the depressurisation problem.

Boeing’s concept proposes a top velocity of five times the speed of sound. That happens to equal the commonly accepted threshold of hypersonic speed, but that wasn’t the reason. According to Boeing’s analysis, M5.0 is the limit achievable with the available structural, propulsive and fuel technology.

“We have the technology today and the design tools to do this,” Bowcutt says. “We don’t have to invent some new thing.”

The engine for the hypersonic airliner is a good example. A M6.0 aircraft requires a supersonic combustion ramjet (or “scramjet”) engine, a technology that still isn’t mature after decades of research and demonstration. A M5.0 aircraft, however, has access to other propulsion options, Bowcutt says.

The fastest passenger-carrying aircraft with an air-breathing engine in history is the Lockheed SR-71A. It flew at speeds up to Mach 3.2 using two Pratt & Whitney J58 engines. The J58 featured a unique configuration called a turboramjet. The engine functioned like a turbojet up to about M2, then diverted air from the compressor into ducts that emptied in the afterburner. The effect was similar to a ramjet.

Boeing’s hypersonic airliner also would use a turboramjet configuration, with some variations compared to the J58, Bowcutt says. Instead of ducting only a portion of the airflow around combustor over M2, Boeing’s concept might bypass all of the airflow around the engine core at higher speeds, he says.

Bowcutt is familiar with hypersonic vehicles. He is credited as the “father of the X-51”. He designed the vehicle in 1995 to become a missile, but it turned into a hypersonic demonstrator funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory. The X-51 used JP-7 fuel — the same kerosene formula that powered the SR-71A — as both a source of combustion and as a coolant system. Since the hypersonic airliner concept won’t travel than M5.0, Bowcutt says, it doesn’t require JP-7. Standard Jet-A fuel. Liquid methane or some combination of those fuels are options for the commercial aircraft.

Finally, Boeing selected M5.0 as the top speed because that greatly simplifies the structural materials. Instead of exotic, heat-absorbing materials like ceramic matrix composites, standard titanium alloys used in aircraft and jet engines today are strong enough to survive the surface temperatures ranging up to 600°C (1,100°F).

M5.0 is already 625% faster than a typical subsonic airliner cruising at M0.8, Bowcutt says. Higher speeds produce significantly greater challenges, with sharply dwindling returns. A M6.0 aircraft, for example, can fly only 20% faster than Boeing’s concept, he explains, but requires the designer to use nickel instead of titanium and unproven scramjets instead of turboramjets.

That more than six-fold increase in speed also drives the business case for the hypersonic airliner.

Hyslop compares hypersonic technology to a supersonic airliner, like the M2.0 British Aerospace/Aerospatiale Concorde. That speed allowed the Concorde, in theory, to cross the Atlantic twice a day using the same crew (although British Airways and Air France chose not to exploit that advantage). By contrast, the hypersonic airliner, in theory, might be able to cross the Atlantic four or five times a day with the same crew, he says. The difference in utilisation rate potentially makes the hypersonic airliner more attractive than the costs of operating a supersonic jet, he says.

“Would that be the tipping out where it economically makes sense?” Hyslop asks, rhetorically. “This whole business about how frequently can you turn an airplane — the economic engineering — looks more intriguing to us the faster you can go. That might be a sweet spot.”",Flight Global,1
"US investigators are scrambling to understand how a young mechanic was able to steal an empty passenger plane from Seattle’s main airport, fly for more than an hour doing tricks and then crash into a forest, killing himself.

The 76-seat plane had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma Airport, in the northwestern US state of Washington, on Friday night and was soon accompanied by two F-15 fighter jets which were scrambled into the air.

Attempts were made over radio transmissions to the convince the pilot - named locally as Richard Russell, who had worked for the airline for three and a half years - to land. However he ultimately crashed into Ketron Island, a sparsely-populated area of the state.

"The history of in-flight service is rich with – in some cases apocryphal – tales of carriers removing one peanut or piece of fruit per passenger and consequently saving tens of thousands of dollars a year. Such decisions were straightforward, born of a desire to save money.

Today, big data offers a theoretically much more nuanced and powerful approach to optimising passenger services, carrying the potential to reduce wastage and drive new revenues. That might, for example, mean tailoring the products loaded on the aircraft to individual flights or customers, or personalising the ancillaries offered during the booking process.

Such initiatives can be facilitated by the structured harvesting of existing airline data – everything from onboard sales through to a specific customer's buying habits.

There are limitations to consider, however. Presuming the recording and collation process is to a high standard – a significant challenge in its own right – data is great at telling you what has happened. But establishing the ""why"", and how the business should therefore respond, is fraught with pitfalls.

POTENTIAL CONFUSION

Confirmation bias is a common problem, for instance. This occurs when data is wittingly interpreted to confirm a pre-existing hypothesis. For airlines fixated on big data as a money-saving opportunity, that is a real danger. There is also the potential confusion between correlation and causation, where it is incorrectly assumed that because two things co-exist, one is the result of the other – when both may have been caused by a third factor.

When hasty or ill-informed interpretation of data happens, all that is likely to be achieved is the entrenchment of suboptimal norms – at best.

Looking at sales of in-flight food as an example, data will not tell you why very few people are buying your sandwiches. But a carrier with a fixation on using data to cut wastage might see that data and cut the number of sandwiches loaded on to aircraft, then celebrate the financial saving. In reality, however, it could be missing out on a significant growth in revenues, simply because it is ignoring the fact that its cheese and tomato baguette is revolting.

Data might also tell an airline that duty-free purchases on evening flights to holiday destinations are very low. Could it be, however, that overworked cabin crew are spending so long on the food and drinks service that duty-free sales fall by the wayside? Based on data alone, cutting the amount of duty-free loaded on such flights might seem logical, but perhaps more revenue could be achieved by instead rethinking how service is delivered.

INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS

A similar conundrum applies to personalisation strategies. It might be established, for example, that a certain passenger never books hotels through a particular airline, only flights. One interpretation might be that marketing hotels to that passenger is a waste of time; more revenue could be achieved by marketing other products to them instead.

Making that decision based on data alone, however, risks ignoring other factors – might your hotel offering be poor or too pricey for a particular destination? Might this passenger prefer to book flights first, then hotels much closer to the departure date using another provider? Again, data will capture what has happened in a particular scenario for a particular business, but not why.

Problems with interpreting data still vex those dealing with some of the most critical information handled by humans – such as that associated with trials of life-saving medicines – so it should be no surprise that airlines would be vulnerable to the same.

None of this means big data is a bad thing – far from it. Handled correctly, it carries the potential for airlines to differentiate their services in what is an increasing commoditised market.

But big data alone cannot provide answers to everything. A holistic and open-minded approach to decision making will always be required, as will a recognition that even those most adept at interpreting data face a daily fight to ensure they are reaching optimal conclusions.

"Swiss maintenance specialist SR Technics has won an engine support agreement from Lufthansa’s low-cost arm Eurowings.

The Zürich-based maintenance, repair and overhaul provider says that Eurowings has signed a two-year MRO agreement for more than 30 CFM International CFM56-5B engines powering the airline’s Airbus A320-family fleet.

Services include shop visits to SR Technics’ facility in Zürich, aerofoil repairs at the MRO’s dedicated repair site in Irish city Cork, plus parts and material management.

SR Technics says the co-operation began in January when Eurowings required individual shop visits to meet its engine MRO demands.

Lufthansa Group tends to handle engine maintenance for its airline subsidiaries through in-house engineering division Lufthansa Technik, which has an overhaul shop in Hamburg that supports CFM powerplants and International Aero Engines V2500s.

Over the last year, Eurowings has acquired a fleet of A320-family aircraft from defunct German carrier Air Berlin.

Prior to that, SR Technics serviced Air Berlin’s CFM56 and A330-powering Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines at its Zürich site.

The MRO says that availability of “slots that met the carrier’s [Eurowings’] planning needs and SR Technics’ continuous support were key to clinching the two-year contract”.

Describing the relationship with Eurowings as “excellent”, SR Technics commercial chief Michael Sattler states that the agreement was reached because the MRO was able to “adapt to challenging scheduling requirements and offer flexible solutions”.

"LATAM Airlines Group expects to have its entire Boeing 787 fleet back in service by year-end, after it was forced to ground more than half of its 787s in the second quarter due to engine issues.

The airline currently has six 787s on the ground, down from a peak of 13 aircraft in June, LATAM chief financial officer Ramiro Alfonsin said earlier today on an earnings call. The six aircraft are awaiting preventive engine maintenance from Rolls-Royce, says LATAM, which has a total fleet of 24 787s.

LATAM hopes to have no aircraft on the ground by year-end, says Alfonsin, adding that the 787 grounding was a ""most critical situation"" for the airline during the second quarter.

Like other Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 operators worldwide, LATAM has suffered from 787 disruptions for months. The airline has sought to mitigate this with leased aircraft and schedule changes.

LATAM returned one wet-leased aircraft in July, and plans to return two of the six remaining leased aircraft in September. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows the airline returned a Boeing 747 to Spain's Wamos Air in July, and is scheduled to return two Airbus A330-200s to Wamos in September.

"Embraer has highlighted Alaska Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines as US carriers that would most benefit from operating the Brazilian company's new-generation E-Jet E2 family.

A top Embraer executive described those airlines as ""market opportunities"" on 22 August, shining light on Embraer's marketing strategy following a recent sales loss to JetBlue Airways and a still-uncertain tie-up with Boeing.

Embraer also faces invigorated competition from the now-Airbus-backed A220, formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries.

""The E2 is different from anything else on the market,"" Embraer Commercial Aircraft vice-president of marketing Rodrigo Silva e Souza tells reporters at the company's Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airport facility. ""It's a completely new aircraft.""

He cites the E2's newly designed wing, fly-by-wire technology, efficient Pratt & Whitney geared turbofans, two-by-two seating and veteran support network as prime attributes.

In laying out specific reasons why Alaska, Spirit and United would be smart to acquire E2s, Souza stresses that the E2 line's low trip cost can enable Alaska, Spirit and United to successfully expand into smaller, yet undeveloped markets. He also says E2s are ideal replacements for Boeing 737-700s and Airbus A319s.

FlightGlobal

The E2 line, which includes the recently certified E190-E2 and the in-development E175-E2 and E195-E2, collectively occupies the roughly 76- to 146-seat market.

Alaska has not yet expressed interest in E2s and remains focused on taking delivery of its outstanding E175 orders, it says.

Spirit has not responded to requests to comment about potential E2 plans. United declines to comment.

United has already expressed interest in purchasing small narrowbodies such as E2s, A220s, 737 Max 7s or A319neos. Likewise, all-Airbus operator Spirit has indicated talks with Airbus, Boeing and Embraer about an aircraft order that could come in six months, Spirit chief executive Robert Fornaro recently told reporters.

Embraer's Souza notes that United has recently been adding more flights to its hubs, particularly flights from smaller cities – an effort to carry more connecting, higher-yielding passengers.

""The E2 could have an important role for United,"" Souza says. ""The size of the aircraft… [is] perfect to develop those new routes, and to have a higher profitability.""

He presents data showing that 53% of United's passengers connect – a rate several points less than American Airlines' and Delta Air Lines' connection rates.

""It needs to improve connectivity,"" Souza says of United.

Likewise, E2s would enable Spirit to launch service on ""long and thin"" routes currently bypassed by a route network that primarily connects major markets, Souza says.

Spirit currently operates 31 A319s, the smallest aircraft in its fleet, according to FlightGlobal's Fleets Analyzer database.

""The A319 is certainly not the most efficient aircraft to do that,"" says Souza. ""If you want to go to smaller markets, what you really want in your fleet is a low trip cost.""

The same goes for Alaska Airlines, which operates 10 A319s and in recent years has expanded significantly to mid-America, mid-sized markets, such as Milwaukee, Omaha and St Louis. Alaska has done so largely using current-generation E175s.

""We see opportunities… for replacing A319s, and to be the small narrowbody in their fleet,"" Souza says of Alaska.

CLOSING SALES

Recent months have seen upheaval in the small-narrowbody aircraft market, with Airbus acquiring a majority ownership of the CSeries, and Boeing and Embraer announcing their intention to form a commercial aircraft joint venture.

The Airbus-CSeries deal, which closed in July, did seem to invigorate interest in the now-branded A220.

That same month JetBlue Airways chose not to acquire E2s, instead ordering 60 A220-300s. Those aircraft will replace JetBlue's 60 existing E190s, which it plans to divest by 2025.

Then during the Farnborough air show Airbus also announced that David Neeleman, who founded JetBlue, tentatively agreed to buy 60 A220-300s as part of a plan to start a new US carrier.

Airbus' current A220 backlog stands at about 360 aircraft, it says.

Embraer's deal with Boeing, however, remains unsettled, with the companies having said the agreement will be finalised by the end of 2019.

Embraer executives decline to provide updated information about the potential tie-up.

Meanwhile, Embraer's E2 order book has remained relatively flat. The company held unfilled orders for 227 E2s at the end of June, though in July Wataniya Airways ordered 10 E195-E2s

Those figures remain only a fraction of the thousands of E2-sized aircraft that Embraer predicts airlines will need in the next 20 years.

But Souza insists an E2 order wave will soon crest, predicting interest will surge as more aircraft enter service.

Embraer delivered the first variant, the E190-E2, to Norwegian carrier Wideroe earlier this year. It expects to certify the first E195-E2 in 2019 and the final variant, the E175-E2, in 2021.

""Over the next 12 months we should see an increase in sales activity,"" Souza says. ""Next year I expect more activity"" from North American carriers, he adds.",Flight Global,0

"ATR predicts that 1,000 turboprops will be needed in Asia-Pacific over the next 20 years, with a number of those aircraft to be used to open up new routes.

Sales director Laurent Janitza says that around 820 will be in the 70-seat category, with the remainder in the 50-seat market.

The prediction underlines the importance of Asia-Pacific for the manufacturer, with operators including Lion Air, IndiGo, Garuda Indonesia, and PNG Air already representing around half of its orderbook.

Janitza explains that demand for turboprops in Southeast Asia will primarily be driven by network growth. Last year, the manufacturer says that 36 new routes operated by ATRs were launched in Indonesia, 12 in the Philippines, and four in Thailand.

ATRs are also being used to replace jets in some markets, such as Taiwan where Mandarin Airlines, Far Eastern Air Transport, and UNI Air are flying turboprops on domestic routes.

At the same time, some ageing turboprops in more mature markets, such as Australia, will require replacement by 2037.

Janitza welcomes the July announcement that turboprop operators at Singapore Changi airport will be moved to Seletar after a new terminal is opened there later this year.

""This is a good news for us; we think it's going to drive demand. The fact that you have a dedicated airport for turboprops is going to drive airlines to think what to do with it. Since it's a turboprop airport, it's going to be an opportunity.""

"Boeing has released details about the design of the landing gear on the 737 Max 10, the longest version of the Max aircraft family.

The company has long been studying different gear options, but has settled on a levered design that enables the gear to extend 241mm (9.5in) upon rotation during take-off, says 737 Max chief project engineer Gary Hamatani in a video released by Boeing.

Boeing

""We've put in this new lever. This lever extends down that 9.5in to provide us that rotation,"" he says (above).

The design is similar to the gear on the 777-300, Boeing says.

United Technologies Aerospace Systems manufactures the landing gear.

Boeing launched the CFM International Leap-1B-powered 737 Max 10 at the Paris air show in 2017.

The aircraft will carry 188 passengers and have a range of 3,300nm, Boeing says.

But the Max 10 has a length of 43.8m, about 1.6m longer than the next largest Max variant, the Max 9. That meant Boeing needed to modify the gear while maintaining type commonality.

Boeing

""A longer fuselage, typically necessitates a longer landing gear. But a longer landing gear would then require changes to items such as the main gear wheel well,"" says Hamatani. ""We wanted to preserve commonality in the Max family. We needed to get the landing gear back into the same unchanged wheel well as the Max 8 and 9.""

In addition to the lever, the Max 10's main gear has a steel ""innovating shrinking mechanism"", dubbed a ""shrink link"" (above), that pulls the inner cylinder as the gear retracts, enabling it to fit in the same wheel well, he says.

""From a pilot's perspective, there is absolutely nothing different from the Max 10 landing gear and the existing Max family,"" Hamatani adds.",Flight Global,0

"GoAir expects that increased availability of spare leased Pratt & Whitney PW1100G geared turbofan engines will soon allow it to fully utilise its Airbus A320neos.

The Indian low-cost carrier has been forced to ground some of its 17 A320neos due to combustor and knife-edge seal issues with the engines, and Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that two are presently in temporary storage.

Speaking in a television interview with BloombergQuint on 30 August, chief executive Cornelis Vrieswijk said that the airline is now seeing more spare PW1100Gs available to cover those taken off-wing for inspections and repairs.

""There is a significant supply of lease engines now available for us in order to cope with the problem [of grounded aircraft].... I think the supply of lease engines... will help us to fly the total [A320neo] fleet, and going forward I anticipate this problem will be [under] control.""

Vrieswijk adds that most of GoAir's 17 A320neos currently have the latest production standard 'Block C' PW1100G engines, which features a new combustor liner, although ""one or two"" still use older Block B engines that are on a preventive inspection programme.

That programme mimimises the risk of in-flight shutdowns, as it allows them to monitor the engines for deterioration, allowing them to be removed before causing a major issue.

""The Block C is behaving a lot better than the Block B going forward,"" Vrieswijk adds.

Despite the issues it has experienced with the PW1100Gs, he adds that overall the A320neos are showing an 18%-19% improvement in fuel burn compared with its baseline A320s.

It selected the P&W engine to power 72 A320neos that were ordered in 2011.

"Dutch aerospace research centre NLR has highlighted potential safety risks of passengers wearing virtual-reality headsets, after a cabin simulator trial at KLM's base in Amsterdam.

Some 40 KLM employees volunteering as passengers and crew took part in the two-day evaluation, which involved three flight scenarios each lasting about 10-20min – a calm flight, turbulence, and a rapid decompression.

Two-thirds of the participants were given VR headsets, while the remaining volunteers viewed the same content – a virtual representation of flight transfers at Schiphol airport – on mobile phones.

NLR says flight attendants had to make a ""greater effort to establish contact"" with participants wearing VR headsets during the calm scenario, which otherwise did not reveal ""anything out of the ordinary"".

During the decompression trial, some of the VR headset users – ""remarkably"" – were ""unaware of the emergency because they were entirely absorbed in their virtual world"", despite simulated shaking of the cabin, deployment of oxygen masks, noise, light flashes and the crew calling out instructions, says NLR.

Noting that the trial has yet to be fully analysed, with results due to be published in September, NLR adds: ""The effect that researchers suspected beforehand was apparent during the test, namely that wearing a VR headset affects communication between passengers and crew.""

Employment of VR headsets ""might affect the level of onboard service, and there is potentially also a safety risk"", says NLR.

The researchers acknowledge that VR headsets ""can provide an experience [and] be informative"", but warn that the technology's employment ""should not be at the expense of communication with the crew and safety on board"".

For development of VR apps, ""it is important to take these matters into account"", argues NLR.

A participant of the trial recalls in a blog hosted by KLM that it was difficult to navigate the virtual walk through Schiphol during the turbulence scenario and that she inadvertently hit her seat neighbour's hand in the process.

""The cabin crew must have nerves of steel. It takes complete discipline on their part to keep those of us with VR glasses in line. We hardly even respond when they offer us our meals… Social skills? Forget it!"" she writes.

The participant asserts, however, that VR provides new opportunities for IFE and suggests that the technology could be employed to inform passengers about safety procedures in a more instructive manner than via films or cabin-crew instructions.

Funded by the EU, the trial is part of a research project into the use of VR on board aircraft which was launched in 2016 under the the bloc's Clean Sky programme.",Flight Global,0

"CFM International's newly published aftermarket policies could spur reshuffling of the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry, leading maintenance shops to adjust business models as airlines consider lower-cost maintenance options, insiders say.

With the policies, some CFM-licensed shops could begin selling non-CFM-approved parts and repairs, while independent shops could align with the engine maker, says Dave Marcontell, general manager of consultancy Oliver Wyman's Cavok unit.

""Previously, you had to be an authorised service center or independent, but not both,"" he says. ""Now those shops can do different types of builds.""

On 31 July, CFM released 41 pages of ""conduct policies"", broadly saying its service licenses and warranties do not discriminate against use of so-called PMA parts or DER repairs in engines.

PMAs (""parts manufacturer approval"") and DERs (""designated engineering representatives"") are regulator-approved maintenance alternatives.

GE Aviation and Safran Aircraft Engines jointly own CFM.

MROs generally welcome CFM's policies, but remain hopeful CFM's competitors will make similar changes, says Sarah MacLeod, executive director of the Aeronautical Repair Station Association (ARSA).

""They are really looking to see if this is going to set a precedent for other manufacturers,"" she says.

The policies are part of an agreement with trade group IATA, which in 2016 filed complaints against CFM and Honeywell with the European Commission's competition office.

The Commission has not released the complaints, which IATA said related to an investigation into ""alleged abuses of dominant positions by manufacturers of aviation equipment"".

IATA has now withdrawn its CFM complaint, saying CFM's new policies will boost competition among service providers. The Honeywell complaint remains open, says IATA.

The European Commission says the IATA-CFM agreement ""appears to deal effectively with concerns that have been raised in the maintenance and repair of aircraft engines sector"".

""CONDUCT POLICIES""

IATA's complaint presented CFM an opportunity to talk with IATA about airlines' concerns, and to address concerns with the policy document, GE Aviation general manager of services marketing Bill Dwyer tells FlightGlobal.

""This is about clarity and transparency,"" Dwyer says. ""There have been a lot of things clarified that were misunderstood previously.""

The policies specify that the presence of PMAs or DERs in engines do not void engine warranties – unless those parts and repairs caused a CFM part failure.

That has always been the case, but needed to be clearly communicated, Dwyer says.

Also, CFM specifies that its service licensees may employ PMAs and DERs. They may also maintain CFM engines containing non-CFM-approved parts and repairs, and do so using CFM's shop manuals.

If CFM unexpectedly finds non-CFM parts in an engine, it will offer to reinstall those parts if in working order, it says.

In a change, CFM will stop charging overhaul shops royalty fees to use engine shop manuals, the policy says. Airlines themselves already have free access to manuals.

CFM made that change because airlines without in-house MRO shops complained their contracted shops had to pay extra for manuals, Dwyer says.

CFM says the policies affirm its ""commitment"" to open competition and the ""competitive nature of its MRO model"".

The policies apply to CFM56 and Leap engines, and GE will apply the policies to its commercial engines, the companies say.

EXISTING FEDERAL REGULATIONS

ARSA's MacLeod views CFM's policies as positive, but says they largely acknowledge existing US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.

Regulations require MROs follow carriers’ maintenance instructions, including requests to use PMAs and DERs, she says. Therefore, CFM lacks authority to prohibit airlines – and, by extension, their maintenance providers – from using FAA-approved methods, says MacLeod.

Likewise, a 2012 FAA policy statement already ensures MROs shops can receive OEM manuals from airline customers, MacLeod adds.

""To me, these are giveaways,"" she says of CFM's new policies. “The airlines, and thus their maintenance providers, shouldn’t have been restricted to begin with.""

MacLeod urges aircraft buyers to leverage regulations when negotiating contracts.

""The proper use of the regulations during negotiation for new aircraft is paramount to stopping most of these restrictive practices,"" she says.

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

CFM's policy statement follows years during which OEMs sought to expand their aftermarket reach.

About 20 years ago, some OEMs, seeking to sell new parts, began stripping repair instructions from service manuals, insiders note.

OEMs formed global networks of licensed servicers that followed OEM guidelines, while non-affiliated ""independent"" MROs competed partly by offering lower-cost PMAs and DERs.

But CFM's new policies could encourage CFM-licensed shops to expand into PMAs and DERs, possibly taking sales from independent shops, Oliver Wyman's Marcontell says.

Likewise, airlines might increasingly ask CFM-licensed shops to perform such work.

""Now airlines can start to actually drive… decisions around what [is] an acceptable build, in terms of using PMA parts and DER repairs to lower costs,"" Marcontell says.

Some independents might suffer from new competition from licensed shops; but others, now having free service manuals, might expand by performing CFM-compliant repairs, Marcontell says.",Flight Global,1

"Its stalwarts range from household names on whose products much of the world’s population regularly travels to manufacturers of highly specialised equipment from passenger seats to cockpit controls. FlightGlobal’s ranking of the biggest 100 businesses in aerospace is a club that rarely admits new members or dramatically changes its hierarchy.

Aside from the occasional merger or takeover that sees established brands disappear, or – bolstered with another company’s revenues – race up the rankings, the industry’s elite appears chary of outsiders. Scarcely do more than half a dozen debutants make it into the Top 100. Existing members rarely move by more than a few places in the rankings from year to year.

The club is modestly profitable – avoiding, with just four exceptions in this year’s analysis, what might be seen as vulgarly high operating margins of more than 20%. But it is getting more efficient. Although for two years running, overall revenues have barely nudged upwards, there have been double-digit increases in operating returns, suggesting a new fondness for leaning-out rather than fattening-up.

That pressure to deliver greater value and trim costs has come from the top – Airbus and Boeing – and permeated all strata of the industry. Our analysis suggests tier one and larger tier two companies – who make up our Top 100 – have managed to push those demands for lower prices further down the supply chain.

As with the establishment anywhere, power in the Top 100 is skewed to the very top. The largest 20 businesses make more than 82% of the profits, on less than 76% of the sales.

The Top 100 is also largely a gentleman’s club. Just as women are slowly emerging on the flightdeck and in airline boardrooms, so too are they in aerospace, with at least two female chief executives among the companies in our survey, and several more in C-suite roles. However, profiles of senior management teams on most corporate websites and glossy annual reports do little to dispel the stereotype of an industry run by middle-aged, white men, who have risen up the male-dominated professions of engineering and accountancy.

Do not expect to see many technology disruptors or entrepreneurial start-ups on a rapid growth trajectory in the Top 100 any time soon. Aerospace is an industry based on long lead times and high entry barriers. The Top 100 is an agreeable club to be in, but it is never easy to gain admittance.

"Boeing has released its first images of a largely-assembled 777X and disclosed details about the structural testing its static test 777X will soon undergo.

The company posted video of its static test 777X and its first flight-test 777X on social media on 5 September.

Both aircraft are 777-9 variants and were at Boeing's Everett manufacturing site.

Boeing, which had previously released only digital renderings of the 777X, says the video follows the recent completion of the joining of the static test aircraft's body sections.

That test airframe will be the first 777X off the line at Boeing's Everett site, Doreen Bingo, Boeing's static test aircraft lead, says in the video.

The test airframe lacks engines and avionics systems and will be used exclusively for ground-based testing, she says.

Boeing will soon subject the airframe to a series of tests designed to evaluate the strength of structures like the wings, struts and the fuselage.

For instance, Boeing will ""attach loads to the wing and distribute the load in a way that emulates air loads"", she says. When subjected to this ""ultimate load"" test, the wing of the original 777 flexed 8.1m (26.5ft).

The static test aircraft's wing includes the wingtip but lacks the wingtip folding mechanism that will be found on production 777Xs, she says.

"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - When Shweta Singh wanted to become a pilot in India 20 years ago, she had to first persuade her parents to let her pick an uncommon profession for women, then deal with unwelcoming male colleagues in the cockpit.

Today, she says, it would be a much easier career to embrace. More Indian women want to become pilots, and more benefits await them: union-mandated equal pay, a safe workplace, day care services and a booming aviation sector.

India has the highest proportion of female commercial pilots in the world at 12 percent, despite the country’s patriarchal society, which typically frowns on women in such jobs.

“It was difficult,” Singh said, recalling her early days of being a pilot. “It was a male-dominated area and not easy to break into.”

But society is changing, said Singh, a senior trainer at Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS) on temporary assignment to India’s aviation regulator as deputy chief flight operations inspector.

The percentage of female pilots in India is twice as high as in most Western countries, including the United States and Australia. Globally, less than 5 percent of pilots are women, according to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots.

Demand for pilots globally is surging. Planemaker Boeing Co (BA.N) estimates a need for 790,000 new pilots globally over the next 20 years, double the current workforce, as air travel rises.

India is the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, with domestic capacity growing 22 percent in the first half of the year, so airlines there are under particular pressure.

Recruiting more women is an obvious way to help solve the pilot shortage, but social constraints have worked against that, said Maria Bucur, a professor of history and gender studies at Indiana University.

“The training and stressful work needed to become and work as a pilot require choices of women that go against most of the gendered expectations our society has of them at that age: to have babies,” she said.

EQUAL RIGHTS

Because pilot pay is based on seniority and flying hours under union agreements, it is one of the rare professions in India where there is no gender pay gap.

The starting salary, including flying allowance, for pilots there is $25,000 to $47,000 a year depending on the airline and type of aircraft. That is similar to the starting salary for corporate lawyers or architects.

About 13 percent of the pilots at IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (INGL.NS), are women, up from 10 percent five years ago, the company said. Some of IndiGo’s 330 female pilots are also managers.

The company provides day care and says it offers pregnant women office duties and an allowance equivalent to what they would have earned flying, helping them “constructively stay engaged with the profession.”

At SpiceJet Ltd, (SPJT.BO) 12 percent of pilots are women, including some department heads, and there is a mandate to grow that to 33 percent in the next three years, chairman Ajay Singh said this year at the Farnborough Airshow in Britain. The company also gives women a fixed monthly flying schedule.

Because everyday safety can be a concern for women in India, airlines offer a pick-up and drop-off service from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Women are accompanied by an armed guard - a practice introduced after a horrific rape in New Delhi in 2012.

“It is the safest job. Women are more protected here than in any other place,” Singh said.

CHANGING SOCIETY

A year after graduating from flight school in 2002, Rupinder Kaur struggled to find a job and wondered whether spending 2 million rupees to get her flying license had been the “biggest blunder” of her life.

It took a year, she said, but she finally landed a job at a regional airline, Air Deccan.

Now, with India’s aviation market booming, finding work is easier, says Kaur, 37, a pilot at IndiGo working on secondment with India’s aviation regulator as a flight operations instructor.

“In India it is generally a rat race, where you choose a profession based on what the majority of people are doing,” she said, adding that airlines should ensure women make up a certain percentage of their workforce, especially in piloting.

“It is still not that easy for us. We have to give our 200 percent,” she said, because women are expected to efficiently manage families and jobs.

The stakes are high for the country as a whole. Women contribute 18 percent to India’s gross domestic product, and only a quarter of India’s workforce is female, according to a report by consultant McKinsey.

In China, women contribute 41 percent of the country’s economy and make up nearly half the workforce.

Recruiting more women to work could help India boost its GDP by 18 percent, or $770 billion, over the usual annual growth, McKinsey said.

There are signs that the number of female pilots in India will keep rising.

At the Bombay Flying Club, which has courses for commercial pilots, the number of women in the classroom has grown to about 25 percent from less than 10 percent five years ago, according to the institute’s principal and chief instructor, C. Kumar.

“The society is changing and there is more acceptance about working in the aviation sector,” Kumar said.",Reuters,0

"Irkut will be able to expand the flight-test programme of the MC-21-300 following load analysis of the wing.

The Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute says it carried out “one of the most important stages” of strength testing for the twinjet’s wing at the end of August.

Manoeuvres such as rapid climbs, it says, can impose high vertical loads on the wing, and the test centred on assessing wing strength for vertical loading up to 2.5g.

Tests on the static airframe – known as the MC-21-300SI – involved applying maximum loads to the wing while other sections, including the fuselage, horizontal stabiliser and engines, were counterbalanced.

“All sections showed good compliance with strength standards,” says the institute, adding that the results will allow “a number of restrictions” on the flight-test aircraft to be lifted, and the certification test programme to expand.

"Zodiac Aerospace's seats business is beginning to bounce back from a production crisis that temporarily crippled the division, but its new owner cautions that a full sales recovery will not be seen for several years.

The seats business, part of Zodiac's cabin-interiors operation, had suffered severe production difficulties from 2015 – drawing criticism from airlines and manufacturers – with the difficulties only easing last year.

But Philippe Petitcolin, chief executive of Safran – which took control of Zodiac in February this year – says the seats business booked in the first half of the year ""a few very good contracts"" with undisclosed customers.

Vertical Aerospace, a Bristol-based start-up founded in 2016, has built and flown the UK’s first electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, a significant milestone for the transport industry’s flying taxi ambitions.

The firm said it had ambitions to make personal air travel on-demand and carbon-free.

Equipped with four propellers at the front and back of a helicopter-shaped body, the vehicle’s vertical take-off and landing technology would allow it to travel between exact locations, without a pilot having to make diversions to an airport.

"SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) bounced back from a production snarl to deliver 48 single-aisle 737s in August and extended its lead over rival Airbus (AIR.PA) for new orders.

Boeing’s August 737 deliveries, announced on Tuesday, were an improvement from the 29 delivered in July, which was one of its lowest monthly tallies in years, due to ongoing supplier delays that caused unfinished aircraft to pile up at its Renton, Washington plant.

The world’s biggest planemaker said it was making “good progress” toward fixing the logjam by year end.

Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ (AIR.PA) A320 family of single-aisle jetliners are each aircraft makers’ cash cows, and deliveries translate into big payments from airlines.

Boeing also said its 2018 net orders totaled 581 aircraft through August, up from 487 toward the end of July. That includes 90 orders in August for 737 variants from leasing firms and unidentified customers.

Industry sources said many of those orders confirmed business unveiled at the Farnborough Airshow in July.

Airbus has been slower to confirm such orders than in the previous two years, when most air show business had been formalized by the end of August. Airbus this week posted 219 net orders for January to August, including five in August.

It had announced firm orders for 145 aircraft at Farnborough, including some in its books before the event took place, leaving around 90 orders still to reach its books.

Airbus said some orders were in the process of being audited and warned against reading too much into the pace of bookings.

“One month is not representative of the entire year, especially August,” a spokesman said, referring to the summer slowdown in European business.

But the gap raised fresh questions over a landmark order for34 extra A330neo wide-body aircraft from AirAsia (AIRA.KL). The Farnborough deal had brought the group’s A330neo order to 100and was seen as key to shoring up the slow-selling model.

It came after a struggle between Airbus and Boeing overlong-haul carrier AirAsia X, part of Malaysia’s AirAsia(AIRA.KL), Airbus’s largest Asian customer. [L8N1UF4RI]

In July, Airbus called that deal “firm,” which observers say usually means approvals have been received and deposits paid. But two industry sources said details had yet to be resolved.

Industry publication CAPA reported last week that AirAsia X could switch 40 of its A330neo orders to the smaller A321neo,effectively cancelling out the Farnborough announcement.

"Boeing has rehired some retired mechanics and taken other steps to bolster its headcount in Renton as part of a broad effort to ensure timely deliveries of 737s, the company says.

The moves come as Boeing works to recover from supplier-driven delays in delivery of key 737 components.

The airframer has ""brought back a small number of recently-retired mechanics with certain skills"" and is hiring new employees to ""help with near-term airplane production requirements"", Boeing says.

""We have dedicated additional resources to the Renton site to ensure timely deliveries to our customers,"" it adds.

Boeing now has about 10,000 staff working in three shifts at its 737 plant in Renton, including about 600 employees transferred to Renton from other nearby Boeing sites, it says.

The hiring comes after Boeing boosted 737 production earlier this year to 52 aircraft per month, up from 47. But the company has struggled with delivery delays, reportedly parking dozens of unfinished aircraft on the ground in Renton.

Boeing has not said how many unfinished 737s are awaiting completion.

Production has been impacted by delays from prime suppliers Spirit AeroSystems and CFM International, Boeing said this year.

CFM makes CFM56 turbofans for 737NGs and Leap powerplants for 737 Max, while Spirit supplies 737 fuselages.

""We are working closely with our suppliers Spirit and CFM as they track toward recovery,"" Boeing tells FlightGlobal. ""Our team has been mitigating supplier delays, and our factory continues to build 52 airplanes per month.""

"Boeing is considering ramping up 737 production further in 2020 despite struggling with significant supply chain problems this year, Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg says on 12 September.

Muilenburg also insists that Boeing is recovering from its current supply chain bottlenecks and predicts that 737 deliveries will accelerate in the remaining months of 2018.

""All of the market signals are telling us [the market] could support a production rate higher than 57 per month,"" says Muilenburg when asked about a possible 2020 production hike.

""We are taking a close look,"" he adds, citing growing worldwide demand for air travel. ""It's pretty clear to me the opportunity is there.""

Muilenburg made his comments during a Morgan Stanley investor conference.

Earlier this year, Boeing boosted 737 production from 47 to 52 aircraft monthly, and plans another hike to 57 aircraft monthly in 2019.

Supply chain problems, however, have slowed Boeing's deliveries, with the company handing over just 29 737s in July and 48 in August.

Muilenburg and others have attributed the slowdown to delays in the delivery of components from engine maker CFM International and fuselage manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems.

""There has been a bit of a challenge with some of our supply chain,"" Muilenburg says.

Production has been further complicated because the 737 line currently manufactures both 737NGs and 737 Max, Muilenburg adds.

However, he insists that Boeing is addressing the problems, noting the company has hired another 600 workers.

Boeing's 737 deliveries in September should be similar or ""a little better"" than August's 48-aircraft rate, and Boeing will hand over more than 52 aircraft monthly during the fourth quarter, Muilenburg predicts.

""Our recovery actions are taking hold and being effective,"" he says. ""We are confident we can get our arms around it.""

"UK investigators have determined that a fatigue crack in the nose-gear axle of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 caused one of the wheels to detach on take-off from London Stansted.

The left axle of the inner cylinder failed as the jet (EI-DLV) turned onto runway 22 in preparation for a departure to Copenhagen on 15 September last year. It diverted to East Midlands airport.

Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) analysis found that the axle journal, while being overhauled, had sustained a re-tempering burn during post-chrome plate grinding.

AAIB

This would have resulted in heat-induced cracking in the base metal, it states, which “probably” grew through hydrogen embrittlement cracking during cadmium plating.

Visual inspections did not detect the presence of any cracks in the chrome surface – which, in any case, would have been microscopic – and there was no requirement to conduct an inspection with fluorescent dye.

“Because no cracks were detected, the part was returned to service,” says the inquiry. “Over time, in-service axle flexure caused fatigue cracks to initiate from the hydrogen embrittlement region, and propagate through the wall of the axle.”

It states that, while the cause of the original grinding burns could not be determined, there was “no effective mechanism” for detecting them.

The cylinder involved had previously been installed on a different 737-800, line number 1642, and had accumulated nearly 22,100 cycles since new.

It had been overhauled in December 2014 at just over 17,000 cycles before being installed on the aircraft involved in the incident.

"GE Aviation is to divest its Middle River Aircraft Systems nacelle division to ST Engineering.

The Singaporean group says its US subsidiary, Vision Technologies Aerospace, will acquire all the shares of MRAS for a ""base purchase price"" of $630 million.

Adjusted for items including ""underfunded"" pension obligations, other debt-like items, transaction expenses and net working capital, the net price for the deal has been estimated at $440 million, ST Engineering says.

Based in Baltimore, Maryland, MRAS specialises in the development, production and aftermarket support of nacelles, thrust reversers and aerostructures and employs around 800 staff.

The company is the sole supplier of certain nacelle equipment for GE engines powering the Airbus A330, Boeing 747-8, 767, Comac ARJ21 and Embraer 190.

As a partner of Safran – the sole nacelle supplier for the CFM International Leap-1A, an option on the A320neo – MRAS supplies thrust reversers and other components for that nacelle.

ST Engineering describes the Leap-1A nacelle activity as a key programme for MRAS and forecasts the supplier's production output will grow by 40-50% from current levels.

MRAS is ""well positioned"" for growth opportunities, both in the line-fit and aftermarket business, says ST Engineering.

Together with Safran, MRAS has a joint venture, Nexcelle, which is responsible for entire nacelles on the Leap-1C – an option on the under-development Comac C919 – and GE's Passport engine, employed on Bombardier's Global 7500 business jet.

Nexcelle will not be affected by the divestiture as ST Engineering ""will take over the role of MRAS"", the Singaporean group says.

Noting a range of patents and other intellectual property owned by MRAS, ST Engineering says the US supplier represents a ""strong fit"" for its business and is central to an effort to expand its traditional maintenance-based aerospace activities to the manufacturing arena.

ST Engineering's divisional aerospace president, Lim Serh Ghee, says: ""Moving upstream into the business of design and manufacturing of nacelles will allow us to benefit directly from the robust growth of the global aircraft fleet as an OEM.""

During the six months ended 30 June 2018, MRAS generated a $24 million net profit, the Singaporean group says.

ST Engineering president and chief executive Vincent Chong states the group is on a ""constant lookout to acquire companies in our core business areas or adjacencies that will contribute profitable revenue streams and sharpen our competitive edge"".

He describes MRAS as a ""high-value and complementary business that will enhance our scale, global reach and capture synergies for the group"".

ST Engineering sees ""no compelling reason at this point"" to evaluate a potential expansion of MRAS's footprint beyond its Baltimore base, the group says. But it adds that it will ""explore opportunities to optimise"" the US company's production and supply chain.

Following the divestiture, MRAS will remain ""an important supplier of nacelles on our propulsion systems for many years to come"", says GE Aircraft Engines president and chief executive David Joyce.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) named its second new sales chief in less than a year on Thursday after chief commercial officer Eric Schulz abruptly resigned nine months after being poached from Rolls-Royce (RR.L) to lead the battle for jet sales against Boeing.

A logo of Airbus is pictured at the entrance of the company's delivery center in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, July 10, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau

The European planemaker said Christian Scherer, head of turboprop maker ATR and an Airbus veteran who had been beaten to the job by Schulz in November last year, would take over the position immediately, reporting to Chief Executive Tom Enders.

Reuters earlier exclusively reported that Schulz was expected to resign. Airbus said his decision had been taken for personal reasons.

The surprise exit comes as Airbus faces delays and industry-wide reliability problems with engines that soured relations with several customers and left the Frenchman increasingly frustrated, people familiar with the matter said.

The company now has a battle on its hands to recapture lost ground after its share of orders against Boeing this year slumped to barely a quarter in the wake of a looser than usual set of commitments at the Farnborough Airshow.

Sources said Scherer’s aggressive commercial streak could challenge Boeing’s lead in the airplane market, where the two sides are embroiled in a bruising battle for wide-body sales.

Slideshow (2 Images)

But several note he is not a preacher of ‘market share’ for its own sake, especially where jet market stability is at risk.

TENSIONS

Schulz was picked for the high-profile Airbus post last year after the company bungled efforts to name an internal successor to John Leahy, the U.S.-born sales kingpin who retired in February.

His appointment reflected a desire by the board to bring in outside blood as Airbus endured turmoil over the impact of ongoing UK and French corruption investigations, which severely demoralised the Airbus marketing machine.

But Schulz’s previous position as head of Rolls-Royce civil engines did not always guarantee him a sympathetic hearing from airlines currently suffering problems with Rolls engines on Boeing and Airbus jets, according to multiple aircraft market sources.

He was also widely said to have struggled to get a grip on the complex and sometimes faction-ridden Airbus universe.

Nonetheless, his decision came as a complete surprise to top management who were informed this week, insiders said.

Schulz could not be reached for comment.

Sources had also reported a tense relationship between Schulz and Guillaume Faury, head of the planemaking division, who is the leading internal contender to replace Enders in coming months.

“I think (Schulz) understood which way the wind was blowing,” a person familiar with the company said.

Another person close to the company denied such tensions had triggered Schulz’s decision to leave.

A320NEO ARCHITECT

Before joining turboprop affiliate ATR in 2016, Scherer forged the successful A320neo jet programme and Airbus’s jet manufacturing entry to the U.S. with a plant in Alabama.

The A320neo - an upgrade of Airbus’s most-sold jet with fuel-saving engines - generated thousands of orders and powered Airbus shares to record highs, but has been hit by delays in deliveries of engines mainly from Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N).

In his two years at the helm of ATR, Scherer scored key sales to India and the U.S. but was forced to curb deliveries to Iran after Washington exited an international deal to ease sanctions.

His transfer back to parent Airbus is the second unexpected exit of a French chief at ATR in as many years and could renew pressure for an Italian to occupy the rotating presidency of the firm, co-owned by Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI).",Reuters,1

"What sparked your interest in aviation?

I fell in love with aviation from a very early age. Growing up, I lived next to Newcastle airport in the northeast of England. Every aircraft took off over our house and I was just fascinated by them all. I secured my private pilot's licence when I was 17 years old, and have thoroughly enjoyed the endless sense of freedom that flying gives me.

Why did you launch Sight2Save?

A few years ago, I learned that a staggering 2.5 billion people within developing countries needed a pair of spectacles. This is a hidden global health crisis. It can easily be addressed by issuing pairs of used glasses, which will enable people to see at school or work, then get a job, help their family get out of poverty and contribute to the local economy. It all begins with vision. I launched Sight2Save in 2016 and began using the power of flight to save sight worldwide.

What role does aviation play in your charity?

We began by chartering small aircraft like Cessna 172 Skyhawk piston-singles, as well as Caravan and Beechcraft King Air B200 turboprops to transport spectacles and opticians to remote regions around the world. We also used logistics companies such as FedEx, DHL and UPS to fly dozens of boxes of glasses, optical and sight-saving equipment to these areas.

While this was a good starting point for our non-profit company, we found that working in damp, dark, humid and overcrowded sports halls and schools is far from ideal. Several of our opticians felt that a flying-eye optician, with state-of-the-art equipment and well-lit surroundings, would enable them to help save sight in greater numbers. Sight2Save is currently in advanced talks with several aircraft owners who have expressed an interest in donating their aircraft for these missions. We are also working with a US maintenance, repair and overhaul company that has a supplemental type certification for a specialist ophthalmic interior.

These bespoke aircraft would travel worldwide, spending three weeks at each destination. Once there, Sight2Save will perform sight-saving operations, provide eye tests and spectacles to those in need, and help lay the foundations for a good-quality, accessible eyecare service in each area.

How do you recruit pilots, opticians and support staff?

By word of mouth, getting ourselves noticed and networking at various events worldwide. We like to work with people who share our vision, and who genuinely want to make a difference to those living with a visual impairment worldwide. We also like to recruit entrepreneurially minded staff who can think outside the box and are not afraid to contribute ideas and suggestions towards our plans at Sight2Save.

Sight2Save

As these are voluntary posts, can it be difficult to attract personnel?

Yes, but I have been amazed by the support we have received from both the aviation and optical industries. From retired aviation professionals to pilots saying they have too much time on their hands and would like to be involved, I have been touched by their kindness. We make sure all our staff are happy, and the Sight2Save work is not a burden on them and their time.

It must be an expensive operation to run. How do you fund it?

At present, we are funded through corporate sponsors and donations from Sight2Save sponsors.

What challenges do you face?

Getting the message across about the work we do worldwide. We are not well known yet, so it is essential we build on our credibility, and increase awareness of the Sight2Save and get more individuals and companies involved in supporting out work.

Raising funds to support our flight operations and making sure we can afford to cover the cost of our life-changing, sight-saving work worldwide is also a challenge. But what keeps me going is the thought of having an eye problem here in the UK and not being able to go anywhere to get it treated by an optician. This is the case in developing countries. It frustrates me how in 2018, so many people live with vision impairment or avoidable blindness. We can play our part in helping to eradicate this health crisis.",Flight Global,0

Tigerair Australia and Virgin Tech conducted a full review of all maintenance items from the heavy check, while rectifying the smoke system fault.

The aircraft re-entered service on 22 August. Virgin Australia, the parent company of Tigerair Australia, stresses that the aircraft “did not operate any Regular Public Transport flights…while any fault was detected” and has been operating normally.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that the budget carrier operates four 737-800s and 12 Airbus A320s.

Tigerair Australia has used SIAEP for heavy maintenance on both types for two years, but has not said where it will conduct heavy checks on its fleet after dropping the provider.

Heavy maintenance on Virgin Australia’s 737s is conducted by Air New Zealand Engineering & Maintenance in Christchurch.

"Heathrow and hospitality group Arora have admitted hotel airport car parking charges broke competition law.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) handed Heathrow a £1.6m fine. Arora escaped a penalty after being granted immunity by the CMA for bringing the matter to its attention under a “leniency programme”.

The breach relates to a 2005 lease between Heathrow and Arora, the operator of the Sofitel hotel at what is now Terminal 5.

The Sofitel has a car park that is open to hotel and non-hotel guests. The lease contained a provision that prevented Arora from charging non-hotel guests less than the charges Heathrow levied elsewhere at the airport. The CMA said such a provision was anti-competitive....",Telegraph,0
"Lufthansa Technik is planning a part-divestment of its digital services platform, Aviatar, in an effort to establish a ""neutral"" system for operators to access and analyse aircraft onboard data.

Johannes Bussmann, chief executive of the German MRO provider, tells FlightGlobal that Aviatar will be established as a standalone entity in the short term, and that its ownership will be shared with other players – including competitors – in the MRO sector.

Detailed talks are under way with several MRO providers, he says. LHT will also discuss potential participation with select equipment manufacturers.

LHT launched Aviatar in 2017. Airbus and Boeing made similar preparations to establish their own platforms – Skywise and AnalytX, respectively – later that year.

Rather than just handling data from their own products, both airframers aim to attract operators with mixed fleets to their platforms.

Bussmann thinks it feasible that in the long term, only the two airframers' platforms plus Aviatar and a potential fourth system will be available on the market to access data from the entire aircraft.

Engine data might be handled differently as powerplant manufacturers have established separate data management systems.

Bussmann says Aviatar's objective is not to establish a non-OEM competitor to Skywise and AnalytX that is ultimately controlled by a single party in LHT. ""We would just replace one monopoly with another: that makes no sense,"" he says.

Instead, the non-OEM system is to become an ""open platform"" for data tools and services from different, potentially competing specialists, which would provide operators with ""free"" access to their aircraft data.

Bussmann acknowledges that participant MRO providers on the platform might want to protect intellectual property in relation to their services. He argues, however, that the hosting and accessibility of aircraft data ""must remain independent"".",Flight Global,1

"Swedish cabin environment specialist CTT Systems has won a contract to supply air humidifiers for an unnamed airline's Airbus A350 fleet.

CTT says the equipment will be line-fitted to the business-class sections of the operator's entire A350-900 fleet, with aircraft scheduled for delivery from the second half of 2019 until 2023.

The supplier says the operator is the second A350 airline customer to order humidifiers for the passenger cabin on the long-haul twinjet.

A previous deal disclosed earlier this year with an unnamed airline covered the equipment's installation in the business-class section, cockpit and crew-rest compartments of an A350 fleet.

CTT argues that although the airframers have made ""great progress in lowering cabin altitude, reducing noise and vibrations, generating draft-free and fresher air, multiple temperature zones and advanced mode lighting"" on the their new-generation widebodies – the A350 and Boeing 787 – improving humidity levels will be the ""next"" step to ""elevate the total cabin environment experience"".

CTT acknowledges that a lower cabin altitude on the 787 and A350 versus previous types results in a ""passive” relative humidity increase of up to 2%. But the supplier asserts that, without humidification systems, a typical business-class cabin has a relative humidity of 6-10%, which it describes as ""drier than any of the driest climates on Earth"".

The company's humidifiers are standard equipment in crew-rest compartments on 787s and an option for the compartments on A380s, A350s and the under-development 777X.

Earlier this year, two 777X customers ordered humidifiers for the premium cabins on the twinjets.",Flight Global,0

A Mumbai to Jaipur Jet Airways flight had to be turned back on Wednesday night, due to the failure of the cockpit crew to maintain cabin pressure, a Department of General Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said.

The 9W 697 flight – a Boeing 737 aircraft – had 166 passengers and five crew on board. Thirty of the customers suffered injuries, of which five were admitted to the Dr Balabhai Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai.

"LONDON (Reuters) - British members of parliament demanded an explanation from banking services provider Cashplus after outages left customers unable to receive or make payments this week, the latest in a series of disruptions at British financial firms this year. In a letter published on Thursday, Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee, asked Cashplus boss Richard Wagner what caused the service outage and what steps he has taken to compensate customers and prevent a repeat. Financial technology firm Cashplus is not a bank, but offers prepaid credit cards and current accounts to 1.3 million customers in Britain. It markets its personal accounts to people with poor credit histories, and its business accounts to small firms, Morgan said in the letter.  “A loss of banking services can carry particularly severe consequences for these types of customer, and I have also asked Mr Wagner how those who have lost out will be compensated,” Morgan wrote. Privately owned Cashplus apologised for the outages in a statement posted on its social media channels on Wednesday and Thursday. “All our services are now working as normal. Our CEO will be sending out an email to all customers later today to both apologise and update you on what happened,” Cashplus said. It is the latest financial firm in Britain to face questions about its services this year, after the Treasury Committee earlier asked the payment services firms PayPoint and Visa, and the bank TSB, about service outages.

"NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar must ensure there is “no hiding place” for those responsible for crimes against its Rohingya minority if it is to avoid a lasting stain on the country’s reputation, Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday. Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with local muslim residents in Maungdaw in Rakhine state, Myanmar, September 20, 2018. Ye Aung Thu/Pool via REUTERSHunt told Reuters he pressed Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi on the importance of holding the armed forces accountable for any atrocities, adding that if that did not happen within the country other options should be considered, including referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC). “If there isn’t accountability through domestic processes the international community will not let it rest at that,” said Hunt in an interview at the end of a two-day visit to the former British colony previously known as Burma. “We need to be absolutely clear that there can be no hiding place for anyone responsible for these kinds of atrocities.”   Myanmar’s main government spokesman Zaw Htay was unavailable for comment. United Nations-mandated investigators have said Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with “genocidal intent” in an operation in Rakhine state, in the west of the country, that drove more than 700,000 refugees across the border to Bangladesh.  Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with local residents in Maungdaw, Rakhine state,  Myanmar, September 20, 2018. Ye Aung Thu/Pool via REUTERSThe investigators called for commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and five generals to be prosecuted for genocide and crimes against humanity. Myanmar has rejected the UN findings as “one-sided”. It says the military action, which followed militant attacks on security forces in August last year, was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.  Myanmar has launched several domestic probes that have largely dismissed allegations made by Rohingya refugees. In July, Suu Kyi appointed a commission chaired by retired Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo to investigate the allegations of human rights violations. REUTERS CASE RAISED Hunt said he had witnessed a “climate of fear” during a visit to Rakhine, where he was taken to empty centres built by Myanmar to house Rohingya the government says it is ready to welcome back. Refugees needed to see “accountability and justice” for atrocities to feel confident enough to return, he said. “If there isn’t accountability and justice, this will be as big a stain on Burma’s history as the Khmer Rouge are for Cambodia.”  Asked whether he would support referring Myanmar to the ICC, Hunt said there were “a number of different options”.  In separate comments on Twitter, Hunt noted an ICC referral would need the support of the UN Security Council “which it may not get so we need to look at other options too”. Slideshow (8 Images)A Security Council referral would need nine votes in favour and no vetoes from the permanent members Russia, China, the United States, Britain and France. Diplomats say Russia and China are unlikely to agree to such a move. The ICC declined to comment. On Tuesday, the ICC prosecutor said her office had begun a preliminary examination into whether alleged forced deportations of Rohingya from Myanmar into Bangladesh could constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. During the trip Hunt visited a group supporting political prisoners in Yangon and met Suu Kyi in the capital, Naypyitaw. The military declined Hunt’s request for a meeting, he said. Hunt said he was “extremely concerned” about the case of two Reuters journalists who were arrested last December while investigating a massacre in Rakhine. Reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted this month under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. Hunt said he raised specific concerns with Suu Kyi about the conviction and asked her to consider giving them a pardon.  “She indicated that the judicial processes would probably need to be concluded before that could be considered, but I did put that squarely on the table as something I hoped she would consider,” he said. “This is a critical moment for Burma as one of the newest democracies in the world to show that its court system is effective and there is due process, and I think there are a number of grounds for concern that that didn’t happen in this case.” Reporting by Simon Lewis and Shoon Naing in Naypyitaw; Additional reporting by William James and Elisabeth O'Leary in London and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Editing by Alex RichardsonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",Reuters,0

Liebherr says the equipment is part of the main landing gear steering system and comprises transducers – to measure nose landing gear deflection – together with control units for the main wheel steering mechanism.

If the pilot steers the nose wheel through 13°, the aft axle on each of the 777’s triple-axle main landing gear bogie deflects in order to cut turning radius and reduce tire scrub.

The Swiss-headquartered engineering group says that the German-based landing gear division of Liebherr-Aerospace will design the components, while a separate, dedicated electronics division will manufacture the equipment.

Boeing previously selected Liebherr to supply the supply wing-tip folding mechanism and additional equipment for the high-lift system on the under-development 777X.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Support in Britain for increased levels of tax to fund more public spending has hit a 15-year high, according to a survey published on Friday, after nearly a decade of government efforts to cut its budget deficits. People walk across the Millennium Bridge in central London, Britain, August 3, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) said its survey, based on interviews conducted in 2017, showed 60 percent of respondents backed more tax and spending, up from 49 percent in 2016 and 31 percent in 2010. “Since 2010 the proportion of people who want more tax and spend has nearly doubled and shows the country is clearly tiring of austerity,” NatCen’s Head of Public Attitudes, Roger Harding, said. The survey showed majority support for more tax and spending from voters for the ruling centre-right Conservative Party, which typically favours lower taxes, as well as supporters of the left-wing opposition Labour Party, NatCen said. The last time more than half of Conservative voters thought the government should raise tax and spending was in 2002, it said.  With many voters angry about a fall in their earnings over the past 10 years, when adjusted for inflation, Prime Minister Theresa May promised in June to spend more money on the health service. Britain has slashed its budget deficit from about 10 percent of economic output in 2010 to around 2 percent now. Finance minister Philip Hammond has said his priority is to bring down the stockpile of public debt, which he says remains too high at around 85 percent of GDP. More spending on the health service was the top priority for 54 percent of respondents in the NatCen poll, followed by education with 26 percent and housing 7 percent. A third of those polled said tax and spending levels should stay unchanged and 4 percent thought the government should tax and spend less. The NatCen survey on tax and spending was based on responses from 2,963 people interviewed between July and October last year as part of its broad British Attitudes Survey, other findings of which have been published in recent months. A NatCen spokeswoman said the delay in publishing the findings was typical for the British Attitudes Survey.

"SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - European Union leaders will push for a Brexit deal next month but warned Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that if she will not give ground on trade and the Irish border by November they are ready to cope with Britain crashing out. “Don’t worry, be happy,” joked EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker after telling reporters after a summit in Austria that the Europeans had full plans in place in the event there was no deal before Britain leaves next March. May promised new proposals to reassure Dublin that it would not get a “hard border” with the British province of Northern Ireland but warned she too could live with a no-deal outcome — though many round the summit table in picturesque Salzburg see that as more of a negotiating tactic than a credible threat. She said her “Chequers” proposals for trade with the EU, intended also to resolve arguments over the borders of Northern Ireland, were the only way forward. EU leaders repeated their view the plans would undermine their cherished single market. But leaders also tried to put a positive spin on their 24 hours of talks. Summit chair Donald Tusk said he was more optimistic about getting agreements both to ease Britain out gently and to sketch out a future free trade pact.  Tusk said a Brussels summit on Oct. 18 would be a “moment of truth” to overcome remaining big problems and leaders pencilled in the weekend of Nov. 17-18 to formalise a final agreement. Related CoverageMay's Brexit plans opposed by 40 rebels in her party: former Brexit ministerBut May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among those who stressed there was still “a lot of work” to do.  May faces a fight with angry Conservatives at her party’s conference in 10 days. They deride her willingness to bind Britain into much EU regulation in return for free trade; some would prefer a no-deal “hard Brexit” in March, despite warnings that would ravage the British economy. EU leaders understand that she can give little away before the conference ends on Oct. 3. But they hope their negotiator, Michel Barnier, can secure her agreement next month to what will be new EU proposals. These will be fundamentally unchanged but may be politically more palatable, notably on Northern Ireland. “Ritual dance is always a part of such negotiations,” a senior adviser to one of May’s summit peers told Reuters.  “It may be that they will just accept what we have proposed after the Tory conference.” MERKEL, MACRON SCEPTICAL Whether it can be done by mid-November, many doubt. Brussels is familiar with the theatre of diplomacy, where being seen to hold out to the bitter end can help sell the unpopular back home and some diplomats believe a deal could take until Christmas.

This would keep Northern Ireland under EU economic oversight if London and Brussels cannot agree a trade pact to keep UK-EU borders open after a transition period ends in 2020 — an idea that May and a small party in the province that props up her minority government oppose. “We need to ensure that nothing is done which effectively carves Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom,” May told reporters after Tusk had briefed her on the discussions the other 27 had on Brexit over lunch.

UKIP played a defining role in recent British history as the force that pressured former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on leaving the EU, and then stoked the anti-establishment uprising behind the 2016 ‘leave’ vote.  But, since finding itself on the winning side of the Brexit vote UKIP has struggled to influence the exit process, seeing its voter support evaporate and undergoing two years of inner turmoil to find a leader to replace the talismanic Nigel Farage. On Friday, current leader Gerard Batten published a manifesto document that sought to rediscover the everyman appeal that once made the party a threat to larger rivals from across the British political spectrum.  “These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners,” Batten, a member of the European Parliament, said in a statement launching the 17-page manifesto.  “Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters.” The policies included a “complete and total” withdrawal from the EU, arguing that Britain should end all payments to the EU and adherence to the bloc’s rules - a much more radical break than May is proposing. Batten has been criticised, including by some former UKIP members, for engaging with causes championed by far-right groups, and he has described Islam as a “death cult”.  Other policies, much of which are similar to previous UKIP positions, include selective and limited immigration, scrapping overseas aid, lower domestic taxes and a tougher approach to taxing multinational companies. UKIP currently has no elected representatives in parliament and it gathered only 600,000 votes in a 2017 general election, compared to 3.8 million in 2015 - a fall from more than 12 percent of the total vote to less than 2 percent.  Nevertheless, in many marginal seats it has the power to influence which major party can win and, with no party clearly ahead in opinion polls, has the potential to affect the outcome of any future national election. Although an election is not scheduled until 2022, May’s government remains fragile.

"Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan would like to benchmark aircraft maintenance performance of the US Air Force against commercial operators conducting similar work.

The idea is part of a larger effort by the Department of Defense to improve readiness of the USAF as the service reemphasizes an expeditionary force structure, which calls for the rapid, flexible deployment of aircraft across the world at short notice.

Jokingly calling the concept R&D, or rip-off and deploy, Shanahan’s proposal was made in a speech at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space & Cyber Conference in National Harbor, Maryland on 19 September.

“A custom, federated approach, is a trap,” he says.

Instead, in areas such as engine overhaul, depot throughput and asset utilization the USAF should be looking to copy commercial airline’s maintenance performance.

“Similarities between operating and maintaining aircraft in the military and the commercial world are remarkably high. The similarities in performance are not,” says Shanahan. “We should compare ourselves to commercial analogs in order to guard against insularity.”

The concept worked during World War II, he says, noting the USA put the mass production expertise of manufacturers such as Ford Motor to use building tanks and airplanes.

“Copying industry techniques may not be as simple as going to the hardware store, but it’s faster and cheaper then recreating the wheel,” says Shanahan.",Flight Global,1

"German aerospace research centre DLR is testing on an Airbus A320 test aircraft a range of experimental modifications aimed at reducing noise, especially during the take-off and landing phases.

DLR says the project – dubbed ""Low Noise ATRA"" in reference to the centre's Advanced Technology Research Aircraft – covers 10 modifications, variously intended to avoid steps and gaps in the twinjet's high-lift system and landing gear and to improve the exhaust assembly of the International Aero Engines V2500 powerplants.

Noting that the modifications are at the prototype stage, DLR says the equipment has been designed to provide retrofit options that can audibly reduce noise on in-service aircraft.

The research centre describes aircraft noise as ""one of the most urgent"" issues in aviation and says reduction measures can deliver improvements in the short to medium term, while development and wide deployment of new, quieter aircraft typically takes more than a decade.

A range of partners were involved in the development of the individual modifications.

With Safran, DLR created a main landing gear fairing and wind deflector for the wheel brakes.

The nose landing gear was fitted with a different deflector for the area between the wheels and a panel to cover gaps between the landing gear's taxi lights.

In co-operation with Airbus, DLR developed ""porous"" side edges for wing flaps and slats, to reduce gaps between the aerofoil segments.

DLR

The team also installed panels on the lower wing surface to cover exposed areas just forward of the flaps, when the high-lift devices are extended.

A new, stepped engine exhaust nozzle design has been installed to test potential noise reduction during take-off.

DLR

DLR was due to conduct flight tests with the modified aircraft at Magdeburg-Cochstedt airport between 19 and 21 September.

Having conducted flight tests with the unmodified aircraft at the same airport in 2016, DLR says the trial will enable detailed analysis of the noise-reduction measures' effectiveness.

DLR notes that several of the modifications were developed under a research project – part-funded by the EU – named AFLoNext, which stands for active flow-loads and noise control on next-generation wings.",Flight Global,0
"Southwest Airlines will co-fund a new $130 million regional maintenance facility at Baltimore/Washington International airport, to better meet its needs at the second busiest airport in its network.

Construction of the 12,080m2 (130,000ft2) line maintenance facility will begin early next year, with completion in 2021. Southwest will invest $80 million, with the Maryland Aviation Administration contributing the remaining $50 million.

The three-bay hangar will be the first of its kind for Southwest in the northeast, complementing six maintenance hangars in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Orlando and Phoenix. The facility will include additional exterior parking spots for eight aircraft, as well as office space.

Southwest chief executive Gary Kelly says the facility is yet another signal of the airline's ""serious commitment"" to Baltimore/Washington.

Construction of the hangar is expected to create 450 jobs, but will not significantly grow maintenance employee numbers at the airline. Southwest currently employs more than 120 technical operations staff at the airport, which is its largest line operation and has the most number of Southwest aircraft remaining overnight.

The new facility will provide shelter to these employees in inclement weather, and also provide more space for storage of parts, Kelly tells FlightGlobal.

""It will be nice to have that flexibility,"" he says of the additional maintenance capacity to be provided by the new facility. ""This is an investment for the future, it gives us more hangar positions that we can think about, and will help us move more scheduled maintenance activities up here.""

Southwest operates up to 240 daily departures out of the airport, which is the second busiest in its system after Chicago Midway. The Dallas-based airline is the biggest carrier at Baltimore/Washington, carrying about 69% of its traffic. Asked why the airline did not build the maintenance facility earlier given the scale of its operations at the airport, Kelly says it was a matter of ""priority"".

The airline invested in a network operations control centre in 2014, followed by a new reservations system that rolled out last year, he points out. ""All these things take capital,"" says Kelly. ""We've managed our maintenance needs very well up to this point… we don't have immediate problems we are trying to solve [with the new facility].""

News of the planned maintenance facility comes as the airline celebrates its 25th year of service at Baltimore/Washington. It employs more than 4,800 staff at the airport.",Flight Global,0

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration imposed sanctions on the Chinese military on Thursday for buying fighter jets and missile systems from Russia, in breach of a sweeping U.S. sanctions law punishing Moscow for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. In Beijing, the Chinese government expressed anger and demanded the sanctions be withdrawn. The U.S. State Department said it would immediately impose sanctions on China’s Equipment Development Department (EDD), the military branch responsible for weapons and equipment, and its director, Li Shangfu, for engaging in “significant transactions” with Rosoboronexport, Russia’s main arms exporter. The sanctions are related to China’s purchase of 10 SU-35 combat aircraft in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, the State Department said. They block the Chinese agency, and Li, from applying for export licenses and participating in the U.S. financial system. It also adds them to the Treasury Department’s list of specially designated individuals with whom Americans are barred from doing business. The U.S. also blacklisted another 33 people and entities associated with the Russian military and intelligence, adding them to a list under the 2017 law, known as the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. CAATSA also seeks to punish Russia for its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria’s civil war. “China expresses strong indignation at these unreasonable actions by the U.S. side and has already lodged stern representations,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing, adding the moved seriously harmed bilateral relations and military ties. “We strongly urge the U.S. side to immediately correct the mistake and rescind the so-called sanctions, otherwise the U.S. side will necessarily bear responsibility for the consequences,” he said, without giving details. China has “normal” military exchanges and cooperation with Russia, aimed at protecting regional peace and stability, which is not against international law or aimed at any third party, Geng added. Related CoverageLavrov calls U.S. sanctions aimed at Russian plane maker 'unfair competition' - InterfaxRussia says U.S. is playing with fire by imposing new sanctions on itChina will continue to work with Russia to promote strategic cooperation at an even higher level, he said. Doing significant business with anyone on the U.S. blacklist can trigger sanctions like those imposed on China.  Some of those added to the list, which now contains 72 names, were indicted in connection with Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, a U.S. official said. President Donald Trump on Thursday issued an executive order intended to facilitate implementation of the sanctions. A federal special counsel is leading a criminal investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election, and any possible cooperation with Trump’s presidential campaign. Trump has insisted there was no collusion with Russia. Moscow denies any effort to meddle in U.S. politics.  AIMED AT MOSCOW - OR BEIJING? One U.S. administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said the sanctions imposed on the Chinese agency were aimed at Moscow, not Beijing or its military, despite an escalating trade war between the United States and China. “The ultimate target of these sanctions is Russia. CAATSA sanctions in this context are not intended to undermine the defence capabilities of any particular country,” the official told reporters on a conference call.  “They are instead aimed at imposing costs upon Russia in response to its malign activities,” the official said.  In Moscow, Russian member of parliament Franz Klintsevich said the sanctions would not affect the S-400 and SU-35 deals. “I am sure that these contracts will be executed in line with the schedule,” Klintsevich was quoted as saying by Russia’s Interfax news agency. “The possession of this military equipment is very important for China.” FILE PHOTO: Sukhoi Su-35 multi-role fighters of the Sokoly Rossii (Falcons of Russia) aerobatic team fly in formation during a demonstration flight at the MAKS 2017 air show in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, Russia, July 21, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File PhotoSecurity analysts in Asia said the move was largely symbolic and would only push Moscow and Beijing closer together. “The imposition of U.S. sanctions will have zero impact on Russian arms sales to China,” said Ian Storey, of Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. “Both countries are opposed to what they see as U.S. bullying and these kind of actions will just push Beijing and Moscow even closer together,” he said, adding that Moscow needed Chinese money and Beijing wanted advanced military technology. Collin Koh, a security analyst at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the sanctions would do little to counter the evolving research and development relationship between China and Russia. China relies less on large big-ticket purchases from Russia, but Chinese defence industries are seeking expertise from Russia and former-Soviet states to plug knowledge gaps, he said. The Trump administration is pursuing strategies to clamp down on China and faces growing pressure to respond strongly to U.S. intelligence agency reports that Russia is continuing to meddle in U.S. politics. Members of Congress, including many of Trump’s fellow Republicans, who passed the sanctions bill nearly unanimously, have repeatedly called on the administration to take a harder line against Moscow. Administration officials said they hoped the action against EDD would send a message to others considering buying the S-400. U.S. officials have been discussing the issue particularly with NATO ally Turkey, which wants to buy the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries. Washington has expressed concern that Turkey’s planned deployment of the S-400s could pose a risk to the security of some U.S.-made weapons and other technology used by Turkey, including the F-35 fighter jet. U.S. officials have warned that Turkey’s purchase of the system could contravene CAATSA. “We hope that at least this step will send a signal of our seriousness and perhaps encourage others to think twice about their own engagement with the Russian defence and intelligence sectors,” another U.S. official said.

"Airbus Helicopters is preparing serial production of A350 door components through a 3D-printing process.

The manufacturer says its facility in Donauwörth, Germany, is in the process of qualifying the production of titanium door latch shafts for the long-haul aircraft through additive layer manufacturing, with serial production scheduled to start in early 2019.

Having redesigned the existing titanium latch shaft, the move represents the first large-scale production of metallic 3D-printed components, Airbus says.

The first A350s with the new components are scheduled to fly in 2020.

Airbus says the shaft produced through 3D printing – which uses lasers to melt titanium powder and build up the desired component layer by layer – is 45% more lightweight and delivers a 25% production cost reduction versus a conventionally manufactured component.

As an A350 has 16 latch shafts, employment of the new process translates to an approximately 4kg (8.8lb) weight reduction per aircraft.

Airbus Helicopters is making preparations to produce more A350 door components through 3D printing, and intends to employ the method for parts on its rotorcraft too.

Noting the particular significance of weight savings for helicopters, Luis Martin Diaz, head of industrial service centers at the Donauwörth plant, states: “3D printing should be taken into consideration right from the initial planning stages for new components, which may be able to be manufactured particularly easily and cost-effectively using this method.”",Flight Global,0

"Maintenance and spare-parts providers have welcomed the agreement CFM International has struck with IATA to open up the market for third-party engine support of the manufacturer's engines.

A third-party MRO company tells FlightGlobal that the accord will have a ""huge effect"" on its business and improve the market position of independent maintenance providers versus the OEM.

""The playing field will never be level, but at least they have done so much… to take some of the bumps out,"" says the company. It argues that CFM's pledge to abandon fees for using its engine-shop manual will notably reduce costs for overhaul shops, and be particularly relevant for MRO facilities not affiliated with airlines.

However, CFM's concession entitling operators to install non-OEM material in their engines represents the most fundamental change in the manufacturer's aftermarket policy. In the past, several suppliers – including Pratt & Whitney – developed PMA parts for older CFM56 variants. But on later models, CFM restricted the use of such material – as did other manufacturers, for their engines.

For DER repairs, overhaul shops have had an option to apply to CFM for an approval to complete certain repairs. The manufacturer can then issue a customer-dispatch record to say it has no technical objection against the procedure. But such approvals are at CFM's discretion and only cover specific engines; they are not transferable to others.

""Right now, I keep away from DER repairs and PMA parts, even though some customers want them,"" says the MRO company, citing concern over the possibility of jeopardising both its customer's and its own relationship with CFM.

Noting that ""some, not all"" customers are interested in the use of PMAs, the MRO argues that the possibility of supplying alternative solutions to OEM services represents a key role of third-party maintenance providers. Being able to offer ""options"" is central to the business because it enables the company to ""give something back to the customer"", it says.

This is echoed by a source at SR Technics. The Swiss maintenance provider's overhaul shop specialises in CFM56 and Pratt & Whitney PW4000 support. The source says SR Technics sees its role as a being able to offer customers ""flexible solutions"" and that PMAs for select parts are an option to deliver savings for operators. The MRO provider has good experience with installing a range of PMAs, including high-pressure turbine blades for PW4000s, the source says. It believes that the CFM-IATA accord will spur development of PMA parts for new CFM models.

Eric Mendelson, co-director of PMA supplier Heico, tells FlightGlobal he is ""hopeful"" the agreement will result in a ""more open"" playing field and in greater availability of alternative material and repairs to OEM solutions.

He says that, in the past, the US company supplied airlines with ""hundreds"" of PMAs for CFM56-3, -5A and -5C engines – which power 737 Classics, early Airbus A320-family jets and first-generation A340s, respectively – as well as other manufacturers' engines.

For CFM56-7Bs and -5Bs – which power Boeing 737NGs and the majority of A320ceo-family jets, respectively – Heico developed ""a series"" of PMAs, and gained customers for that material, Mendelson says. But he adds: ""Due to CFM's – what I would term – anti-competitive behaviour, it has been very difficult to sell [these parts].""

He foresees business growth for Heico as a result of the CFM-IATA deal, but does not believe the agreement will lead to structural change in PMA markets or the arrival of new competitors. ""While it is a very attractive business to be in, the OEMs don't cease market share easily. They fight very hard… and if a company goes out and tries to develop a PMA part, it is very difficult [to sell it] once the OEM responds with various predatory acts or pricing decreases,"" he says. ""At Heico, we figured out how to navigate that,"" he adds.

FlightGlobal understands that, before the IATA-CFM agreement was disclosed in July, established parts manufacturer and DER repair specialist Chromalloy had already started the process of developing PMAs for CFM56-5Bs and -7Bs, likely as a result of a maturing fleet for these powerplants and an increased number of operators seeking alternative solutions to OEM material and repairs to keep their equipment in service.

Chromalloy declined to comment on the IATA-CFM deal.

Mendelson thinks ""a lot of OEMs"" are monitoring the agreement between IATA and CFM – and the association's separate complaint against Honeywell – because the manufacturers ""recognise that airlines want competition and they [OEMs] need to permit it"". He says: ""The market is getting bigger and they [OEMs] are still going to be able to do very well. But they need to be able to provide some alternatives as well, or else they face the same kind of scrutiny.""

IATA says its complaints – filed in 2016 – covered CFM and Honeywell. But in 2015, the European Commission sent out questionnaires to airlines and manufacturers as part of a previous preliminary investigation to assess conditions in service agreements. And that probe covered additional OEMs.

Rolls-Royce received a questionnaire from the Commission at the time. Chief executive Warren East said in August that the UK engine maker had heard nothing about the inquiry since it returned the questionnaires.

In the context of the CFM-IATA deal, GE says it will ""voluntarily"" apply to its own commercial engine programmes the new conduct principles relating to third-party maintenance. GE says it is ""not a party to the agreement between IATA and CFM"", but adds that it will apply the new policies to the CF6, CF34, GE90 and GEnx models.

The SR Technics source says that it has set its sights on CFM's Leap engine as a potential follow-up type to its CFM56 maintenance business, it is ""not waiting"" for the IATA-CFM deal. As its parent HNA Group has ordered aircraft powered by both Leap and PW1000G-series turbofans, the MRO provider considers itself in a position to establish capabilities for either engine in future, the source says.

Nevertheless, the source acknowledges that the CFM-IATA accord could simplify access to know-how and accreditation for Leap engines and describes the deal as ""good for competition in general"".",Flight Global,0
"Airbus's goal of bringing its new Airspace cabin to all its aircraft models is coming closer to reality.

The European manufacturer, which already offers Airspace-equipped A350s, has firmed up its A320 Airspace design and completed proving flights of an Airspace-equipped A330-900neo, Airbus vice-president of cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer told reporters on 25 September.

An open question, however, remains when or if Airbus will design an Airspace derivative for its newly-acquired A220, formerly known as the CSeries.

""The target is [that] we achieve a single experience cross-fleet,"" Wuggetzer tells reporters during the Airline Passenger Experience Association's annual expo held in Boston this week.

Airbus introduced its Airspace cabin on A350s. Airlines including Air China, Cathay Pacific, Iberia, Philippine Airlines and Sichuan Airlines are now flying some 200 Airspace A350s, Airbus says.

Airspace cabins have larger overhead bins, new lavatories, sidewalls and updated inflight entertainment systems, among other changes, Airbus says. The airframer describes the cabin in marketing materials as having ""straight lines, clean shapes and clear surfaces"".

Airbus placed an Airspace-equipped A330-900neo (a future TAP aircraft) through about 150h of flight testing, flying the aircraft to 16 cities over 18 days, it says.

Meanwhile, Airbus continues working toward a goal of delivering its first A320-family aircraft with the Airspace cabin in 2020.

""The industrialisation is on track,"" Wuggetzer says of that project. ""We have identified all suppliers.""

Diehl Aerospace will supply A320 lavatories, lighting and sidewalls, while Austrian company FACC will provide overhead bins and the door area, Airbus says.

The new bins, which Airbus calls the ""XL Bin"", have 40% more volume than earlier-generation bins and can accommodate roller bags on their sides, Airbus says.

The airframer will introduce the XL bin in early 2019 when it completes the first A320-family cabin retrofit for American Airlines, Wuggetzer says.

Some 300 of American's Airbus narrowbodies will be retrofitted with the Airspace cabin, he adds.

Airbus has received orders from thirteen airlines for more than 800 A320 Airspace cabins, including cabins on new and retrofitted aircraft, it says.

JetBlue Airways is the A320 Airspace launch customer, while other customers include Delta Air Lines, EasyJet, Turkish Airlines and eight unnamed customers, says Airbus.

A220 CABIN UNCHANGED FOR NOW

Airbus has yet to announce changes to the cabin of its A220. Airbus purchased majority ownership of that aircraft from Bombardier earlier this year.

Wuggetzer insists the A220 already has a modern, spacious and well-conceived cabin, which is supplied by Zodiac Aerospace.

Still, he can envision areas of improvement and notes Airbus prefers for customers to have a choice of cabin suppliers.

"When UK rock singer and aviation buff Bruce Dickinson established in 2012 a maintenance operation in a decommissioned Royal Air Force hangar in the Welsh town of St Athan, a few miles west of Cardiff airport, he envisaged that the site would become a central column in a business spanning aircraft leasing, operation, maintenance and training.

Dickinson foresaw that wet-lease customers would hire what he describes as an ""airline in a box"", with all support activities being provided by the then-new business, Cardiff Aviation.

But now, the company's chairman concedes that plan did not work for the maintenance operation.

The division was ""underperforming"" and was operating on an ""inefficient… hand-to-mouth basis"", Dickinson tells FlightGlobal.

""It was costing the customer money, it was costing us money,"" he says – indicating that he had to use his own capital to keep the business afloat: ""Frankly, we have had to take some pain… I have had to take some pain.""

RETHINK

This led to a business review in 2017, under which new management was brought in and the maintenance operation was established as a standalone business. ""I effectively pressed the reboot button,"" he says.

A five-year contract with tour operator TUI to service Boeing 737s, 757s and 767s was the first under a new strategy of targeting larger, more lucrative airline support agreements.

Dickinson says, however, that additional investment is required to build up capacity and capabilities in order to attract more airline business to Cardiff Aviation's ""Twin Peaks"" two-bay facility.

He says he is in the process of searching for investors and partners to inject ""at least"" £5 million ($6.6 million) into the company.

Talks with operators, including freight specialist FedEx Express, are under way and, Dickinson says, Delta TechOps has been won as a partner to support an effort to gain US Federal Aviation Administration maintenance organisation certification.

Throughout 2018, Cardiff Aviation reviewed internal processes and introduced lean manufacturing initiatives in a bid to improve efficiency and generally ""clean up the organisation [and] to get people on the same page"", says the maintenance, repair and overhaul division’s managing director, Martyn Anderson.

But in order to win more contracts, the MRO provider needs to expand capacity and employ more staff.

Today, the company operates a single maintenance line with around 70 technical staff members, although recruitment is ongoing, which can be employed in two shifts.

Anderson says the majority of employees are permanent staff and that the MRO company hires contractors only when specialist capabilities or additional manpower are required.

BUILDING TRUST

Under the current set-up and workload, Anderson says that ""we hope to get to sort of break-even"" – or even ""slightly profitable"" – during the current winter period. Its longer-term objective is to build trust with larger UK carriers to generate more business during the following winter.

Operating a single or one and a half maintenance lines would be a ""steady-state model"" to keep the company going, says Dickinson. But he adds that that is ""not really one that we want to live with because our model is based on expanding"".

He adds: ""We need the investment in order to expand… The investment is there to boost the company from where it is now to where it should be in a year’s time.""

In future, Dickinson foresees an operation with up to three maintenance lines and that the MRO business could construct a second hangar, potentially as a dedicated paint bay.

Under its new strategy, Cardiff Aviation wants to attract maintenance contracts covering multiple aircraft or longer terms – in order to generate scale efficiencies – from major airlines with large fleets.

In addition to TUI, Dickinson mentions British Airways, EasyJet, UK carrier Jet2 and US operator JetBlue as potential candidate customers.

Anderson acknowledges that operators like BA and TUI complete airframe checks through in-house maintenance facilities that have been optimised to process large fleets with maximum efficiency.

He suggests, however, that such carriers require additional, external maintenance capacity and that they can generate long-term rather than ad hoc contracts with scope for scale effects for third-party MRO providers.

Anderson sees Cardiff Aviation’s competitive edge in being able maintain aircraft up to the size of the 767 in a market where, he says, European airlines are facing a maintenance capacity shortage as a result of fleet growth across the region.

Especially in regard to the UK, he says: “A lot of [commercial] MRO capacity in the UK has disappeared”.

Both Dickinson and Anderson show no worries that Brexit could jeopardise the Cardiff Aviation’s growth plan.

Dickinson argues that the company’s existing European Aviation Safety Agency Part 145 certification can be maintained like the regulatory approvals from other countries that Cardiff Aviation already holds.

“EASA come and audit you, just like [the] Bangladesh [regulator],” he says.

And Anderson believes that operators from the UK and other nations – beyond the EU – represent a large enough market to support Cardiff Aviation’s growth plan.

“We looked at this long and hard,” he says. “We looked at our approvals, we looked at our client base, and we deliberately gone down this road [of] anticipating the worst of impact on us. And I think we are pretty robust.”

He says that the vast majority of Cardiff Aviation’s clients operate UK-based aircraft. “We are not dependent on Europe for our workflow.”",Flight Global,0

"PARIS (Reuters) - The board of Airbus (AIR.PA) is holding an unusual meeting in China as the European planemaker implements plans to increase local assembly of jets - a hike that could help unlock talks over a long-delayed deal to sell up to 180 jets, industry sources said.

The board of Europe’s largest aerospace group travelled to the world’s fastest-growing aviation market for an annual off-site “strategy” session coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the inauguration of Airbus jet assembly at Tianjin near Beijing.

Despite efforts to prevent electronic eavesdropping on discussions held on Chinese soil, the board is expected to stay well clear of sensitive subjects. Besides building jets, Airbus is a major European defence contractor, responsible for the production of France’s nuclear missiles and German fighters.

“They are not going to talk about everything. It will be a general discussion,” an industry source told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: An employee works at the A320 family final assembly line of Airbus factory in Tianjin, China, August 12, 2015. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File Photo

The head of the Airbus planemaking division, Guillaume Faury, seen as a possible successor to Chief Executive Tom Enders whose mandate expires next year, is also in China for the off-site meeting, a person familiar with the matter said.

A spokesman for Airbus said it would not comment on the movements of its senior management or on details of the meeting, said to be taking place in a secured private location.

Booming Chinese air travel is a major driver of record Western production of passenger jets, while China is preparing to showcase its own aerospace industry at an air show next month.

Airbus earlier this year announced plans to increase the number of its best-selling A320-family medium-haul jets assembled at Tianjin from 4 a month to 6 a month by 2020, representing about a tenth of total A320 output.

A year ago it added a completion plant for A330 aircraft in Tianjin, hoping for a boost for its slow-selling A330neo model which gained European safety certification on Wednesday.

However plans for a landmark sale of up to 180 jets during a visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron in January fell through shortly after a perceived gaffe by two European envoys over China’s sensitive historical relationship with Japan.

In June, industry sources said the two sides were once again in jet sale talks bolstered by the production increase and at the Farnborough Airshow a month later, Chinese interests were said to be behind a number of anonymous deals.

Among pending deals, Airbus is urgently trying to close what industry sources described as a provisional $9 billion deal with Chinese lessor ICBC for 80 jets, partially announced in Farnborough without the buyer’s name being disclosed.

“We are always in talks with our customers, but we only communicate when deals are ready,” the Airbus spokesman said.

Bloomberg News reported earlier that the two sides were close to an $18 billion deal.",Reuters,0
"Airbus is preparing to deliver the first A330-900 to launch operator TAP Air Portugal, after belatedly securing European certification for the first member of its re-engined A330 family.

While its original 42-month schedule for developing the A330neo proved over-ambitious, Airbus obtained approval for the aircraft from the European Aviation Safety Agency on 26 September.

It had formally applied 50 months and one day beforehand, just 11 days after unveiling the A330neo at the 2014 Farnborough air show.

EASA lists five initial weight variants for the -900 in its type certification documentation, with maximum take-off weights ranging from 230t to the highest figure of 242t.

Rolls-Royce’s Trent 7000 engines – the exclusive powerplant on the A330neo – had been certified by EASA on 20 July, as a variant of the Trent 1000 for the Boeing 787.

The Trent 7000 is larger than the Trent 700 for the A330 and EASA lists the new engine, at 6,445kg, as being some 300-400kg heavier than the Trent 1000.

EASA puts the take-off thrust of the Trent 7000 at 72,834lb (324kN), compared with 71,100lb for the 700, and a maximum continuous thrust of just over 65,000lb.

Other type certification details illustrate the A330-900’s commonality with its A330-300 predecessor.

The three fuel tanks on each aircraft – wing, centre and trim – have the same capacities, for a total fuel load of just over 139,000 litres.

EASA has also certified the -900 to the same accommodation standards, clearing it for 375 passengers in basic exit configuration and up to 440 with four pairs of type ‘A’ doors.

Airbus is pursuing extended twin-engine operations (ETOPS) approval for the A330neo. The A330-300 obtained ETOPS clearance beyond 180min in 2009.

Customers have placed orders for 224 A330-900s. TAP is taking 10 directly from Airbus and the Portuguese carrier is set to receive four more through lessors.

The airline’s first A330-900, MSN1819, was one of three aircraft participating in some 1,400h of flight tests – including route proving and evaluation of the revamped ‘Airspace’ cabin layout for the twinjet. Certification was achieved 342 days after the A330-900's maiden flight in October last year.

Airbus commercial aircraft president Guillaume Faury says the A330neo has “tremendous market potential” and embodies the airframer’s “spirit of innovation”.

He says TAP will receive its first jet “in the coming weeks”. Delta Air Lines is also an A330-900 customer, and Airbus is expecting to obtain US FAA certification for the aircraft shortly.

Airbus has incorporated several modifications, aside from the new engines, into the A330neo design, including a reshaped wing and ‘sharklet’ wing-tips to increase the span to 64m.

It is set to start test-flying the smaller A330neo variant, the A330-800, within the next few weeks. Airbus is also developing a higher-weight version of both models, taking the maximum take-off weight to 251t and extending the A330-900’s range to 7,200nm.",Flight Global,0

"ZURICH/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission set a mid-October deadline for progress in talks on a treaty governing its economic relationship with Switzerland on Friday, taking a tough line after Bern made no new concessions that could break a logjam weighing on bilateral ties.

Negotiations have dragged on for five years on a treaty that Brussels has demanded for a decade.

The talks are now complicated by Britain’s separate negotiations on divorce terms from the European Union, with the Commission loath to be too soft on the Swiss for fear of providing ammunition to Brexiteers.

Unable to forge domestic consensus on amending rules that protect high Swiss wages from cross-border contractors, the Swiss cabinet proposed continuing negotiations on the basis of its current mandate.

The Swiss labour rules have been the major bone of contention with Brussels, which has been pushing to wrap up an accord by the end of the year.

Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis had told parliament on Thursday that talks had not made enough progress so far to clinch a deal, adding it was “written in the stars” whether a breakthrough was still possible this year.

Such star-gazing was not enough for the Commission.

“Time is pressing and the window of opportunity is closing (in) mid-October,” it said, calling it vital to make progress on disputes over state aid provisions and the Swiss labour rules.

“Our guiding principle in these negotiations remains: those who want to do business in the EU’s internal market need to comply with the rules,” a spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

Brussels has been ratcheting up pressure on non-member Switzerland to agree a pact that would sit atop an existing patchwork of 120 sectoral accords and have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to single market rules.

MIGRATION

The treaty would also provide a more effective platform to resolve disputes, providing greater legal certainty. It would focus on five areas linked to the single market: the free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport, mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm goods.

In a sign of good faith, the Swiss government said it would ask parliament to approve another 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.33 billion) in contributions over a decade to help EU member states handle training and migration issues.

Should treaty talks fail — and time is short ahead of elections in Switzerland and for the European Parliament both due next year — the 120 sectoral accords would stay in effect, but bilateral relations would enter a deep freeze.

Failure to strike a deal would mean no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical devices, if agreements on mutual recognition of standards lapse.

The Commission has threatened not to extend beyond this year recognition of Swiss stock exchange rules that allow cross-border trading, which could touch off tit-for-tat escalation.

After Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year proposed letting joint arbitration panels rather than the European Court of Justice handle some disputes, talks had been making progress.

The offer helped defuse arguments from the right-wing, anti-EU Swiss People’s Party, the largest in parliament, that foreign judges should not be allowed to dictate to the sovereign Swiss.

But negotiations ran aground again in August when Switzerland’s normally pro-Europe centre-left baulked at adapting the labour rules.

With both the left and right opposed to a deal, the treaty would hardly have a chance of surviving a referendum that would be likely under the Swiss system of direct democracy.",Reuters,0

"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has defrocked a 88-year-old Chilean priest who sexually abused teenage boys over a period of many years and is at the centre of a wider abuse scandal that is still under investigation, the Vatican said on Friday.

Father Fernando Karadima was defrocked, or “reduced to the lay state” by the pope on Thursday, a move the Vatican called “exceptional” and done “for the good of the Church”.

Karadima, who lives in a home for the elderly in the Chilean capital Santiago, was notified on Friday.

He was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 and ordered to live a life of “prayer and penitence”, but was not defrocked at the time, the final years of the reign of former Pope Benedict. That meant he was still a priest, although he could not minister in public.

“This justice has been long delayed. It is actually more a reminder of how slow the pope has been to enact meaningful reform,” Anne Barrett-Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a U.S.-based resource centre that tracks cases of clerical abuse worldwide, told Reuters.

She called for the same action to be taken against bishops who allegedly protected Karadima.

Karadima, who has always denied wrongdoing, escaped civilian justice because of the statute of limitations in the country.

Seven Chilean bishops have resigned since June after an investigation into an alleged cover-up of Karadima’s crimes, some of them former proteges of Karadima, who prepared them for the priesthood as young men in Santiago’s up-scale, conservative El Bosque neighbourhood.

Three Chilean men who said they were abused by Karadima accused one, Juan Barros, the former bishop of Osorno, of having witnessed Karadima abuse them. Barros has denied this.

During a trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were “slander” until proven otherwise.

But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members.

Scicluna produced a 2,300-page report accusing Chile’s bishops of “grave negligence” in investigating the allegations and said evidence of sex crimes had been destroyed.

In April, Francis, who is also grappling with sexual abuse crises in the United States, Germany and Australia, held four days of meetings in Rome with the three victims - Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo.

“I have a knot in my stomach. I never thought I would see this day,” Cruz said in a tweet thanking the pope. “He (Karadima) is criminal who has ruined so many people’s lives with his abuse. I hope thousands of survivors feel a bit of the relief I feel today.”

Following the meeting with the victims, Francis summoned all of Chile’s 34 bishops to Rome in May and they offered their resignations en masse. Francis has so far accepted seven, and appointed “apostolic administrators” to run their dioceses.",Reuters,0

They are now part of “How We Mourned,” a sombre exhibit at the Clark County Museum that helps mark the first anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting spree that killed 58 people and wounded over 800 at an outdoor festival on the Las Vegas Strip.

Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired real estate investor, poured gunfire from his 32nd-floor hotel suite into a crowd of 20,000 people attending the Route 91 Harvest festival last Oct. 1, then killed himself before police stormed his room.

In August, authorities closed their investigation without an explanation for what motivated Paddock.

After the carnage, scores of Las Vegas residents and visitors placed an eclectic array of offerings in various areas of the gambling mecca, including the traffic island that’s home to the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign.

Museum Administrator Mark Hall-Patton said only a relatively small portion of the more than 15,000 items collected - approximately 3,000 - were displayed in the exhibit.

With 25 volunteers spending 7,000 hours sorting, photographing and cataloguing what Hall-Patton called trailerloads of items, the artifacts will eventually be placed in storage and made available for study.

“Anything that could be saved, we saved,” Hall-Patton said. “We’re not done yet.” The exhibit is on display until Feb. 28.

The items include everything from stuffed animals, painted rocks and artificial flower bouquets to T-shirts, cowboy hats, whiskey bottles and rosaries.

Schools from as far away as Canada sent letters expressing sympathy. A group from Hawaii brought a peace lei hundreds of yards long, with 58 white crosses. Contributions have come in from around the world.

“This is an international exhibit,” Hall-Patton said, noting tourists “flew into town from overseas” just to present their offerings and pay their respects.”

Many of the items, including a large hand-painted “Vegas Strong” banner signed by hundreds of well-wishers, were created without a thought given to preservation for future generations.

“One of the challenges we have is, how are we going to preserve that?” he said. “They were looked at as a short-term statement of care.”

Sorting through the vast assortment of items from such an emotional time in the community’s history was at times difficult, he said.

“It affects everybody,” Hall-Patton said. “You walk away sometimes. But this is what we do.”",Reuters,0
"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital login codes allowing them to take over nearly 50 million user accounts in its worst security breach ever given the unprecedented level of potential access, adding to what has been a difficult year for the company’s reputation.

Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it has yet to determine whether the attacker misused any accounts or stole private information. It also has not identified the attacker’s location or whether specific victims were targeted. Its initial review suggests the attack was broad in nature.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg described the incident as “really serious” in a conference call with reporters. His account was affected along with that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, a spokeswoman said.

Shares in Facebook fell 2.6 percent on Friday, weighing on major Wall Street stock indexes.

Facebook made headlines earlier this year after profile details from 87 million users was improperly accessed by political data firm Cambridge Analytica. The disclosure has prompted government inquiries into the company’s privacy practices across the world, and fuelled a “#deleteFacebook” social movement among consumers.

U.S. lawmakers said on Friday that the hack may boost calls for data privacy legislation.

“This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.

Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra on Twitter said “I want answers” with a link to a Reuters story on the breach.

‘COMPLEX’ FLAW

Facebook’s latest vulnerability had existed since July 2017, but the company first identified it on Tuesday after spotting a “fairly large” increase in use of its “view as” privacy feature on Sept. 16, executives said.

“View as” allows users to verify their privacy settings by seeing what their own profile looks like to someone else. The flaw inadvertently gave the devices of “view as” users the wrong digital code, which, like a browser cookie, keeps users signed in to a service across multiple visits.

That code could allow the person using “view as” to post and browse from someone else’s Facebook account, potentially exposing private messages, photos and posts. The attacker also could have gained full access to victims’ accounts on any third-party app or website where they had logged in with Facebook credentials.

“The implications of this are huge,” Justin Fier, director of cyber intelligence at security company Darktrace, told Reuters.

Guy Rosen, the Facebook vice president overseeing security, said the flaw was “complex” in that it resulted from three failings.

A video upload feature should not have displayed on a user’s profile page when accessed through “view as,” Rosen told reporters on a conference call. That alone would not have been problematic except that the video feature wrongly triggered the placement of the powerful login code. And it placed the code not for the “view as” user, but for who they were pretending to be.

Facebook fixed the issue on Thursday. It also notified the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Congressional aides and the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where the company has European headquarters.

The Irish authority expressed concern in a statement that Facebook has been “unable to clarify the nature of the breach and risk to users” and said it was pressing Facebook for answers.

Facebook reset the digital keys of the 50 million affected accounts, and as a precaution temporarily disabled “view as” and reset those keys for another 40 million that have been looked up through “view as” over the last year.

About 90 million people will have to log back into Facebook or any of their apps that use a Facebook login, the company said.

Two Facebook users sued the company over the breach in federal court in California on Friday.

More than 6,000 users complained about the breach on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page.

“I’m so scared now. All my activities are on Facebook,” Mohammad ZR Zia, a 25-year-old college student in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who has been using the social media platform since 2009, told Reuters. His account was logged out earlier on Friday.

The level of concern expressed on Facebook was enough that the company’s automated system temporarily blocked sharing of some articles about the breach.

“Our security systems have detected that a lot of people are posting the same content, which could mean that it’s spam,” a message told users. Facebook later apologised for the misfire.

Facebook has suffered narrower breaches before.

In 2013, Facebook disclosed a software flaw that exposed 6 million users’ phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorised viewers for a year, while a technical glitch in 2008 revealed confidential birth-dates on 80 million Facebook users’ profiles.",Reuters,0
"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning 34 minutes after it was first issued following a major earthquake that sent huge waves crashing into the northeastern coast of Sulawesi island, killing hundreds and leaving thousands more homeless.

The 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami, which hit the city of Palu about 1,500 km (940 miles) from Jakarta and further along the coastline, killed at least 384 people. Officials said on Saturday the death toll was likely to rise.

Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their death.

The geophysics agency (BMKG) faced criticism on Saturday on social media, with many questioning if the tsunami warning was lifted too soon.

The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to “end” the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.

“We have no observation data at Palu. So we had to use the data we had and make a call based on that,” said Rahmat Triyono, head of the earthquakes and tsunami centre at BMKG.

He said the closest tide gauge, which measures changes in sea level, only recorded an “insignificant”, six-centimetre (2.5 inches) wave and did not account for the giant waves near Palu.

“If we had a tide gauge or proper data in Palu, of course it would have been better. This is something we must evaluate for the future,” said Triyono.

It was not clear whether the tsunami, which officials say hammered Palu and the surrounding area at extremely high speeds measuring in the hundreds of kilometres per hour, occurred before or after the warning had been lifted.

“Based on the videos circulating on social media, we estimate the tsunami happened before the warning officially ended,” Triyono said.

Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. The most devastating came on Boxing Day in 2004, when a magnitude 9.5 quake triggered a massive tsunami that killed around 226,000 people along the shorelines of the Indian Ocean, including over 126,000 in Indonesia.

The scenic town of Palu sits at the mouth of a narrow bay in northeastern Sulawesi and is home to around 380,000 people. It was hit by a tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to Indonesia’s national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB).

Baptiste Gombert, a geophysics researcher at University of Oxford, said it was “surprising” the quake had generated a tsunami.

Friday’s quake was recorded as a “strike-slip” event where neighbouring tectonic plates move horizontally against each other, rather than vertically, which is what usually generates a tsunami.

“There is some speculation that there was a landslide under the sea which displaced a lot of water and caused the tsunami,” he said, adding the narrow bay may have concentrated the force of the waves as they moved toward the shore.

Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster agency, told reporters his team had been “preparing to send public warnings that were easy to understand” when the tsunami warning was “suddenly ended”.

The communications ministry said repeated warnings were sent out to residents via text message, but Nugroho said the quake had brought down the area’s power and communications lines and there were no sirens along the coast.

Indonesians took to social media to question the BMKG’s move to lift the tsunami warning and a failure to release information in a timely manner.

“So upset.. the warning was lifted.. although a tsunami happened...” said one Twitter user @zanoguccy in a direct message to BMKG.

"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party began gathering for its annual conference on Saturday with bitter divisions over her Brexit plans rising to the fore, raising doubts about her own future.

Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, but the terms of the departure remain unclear. May, under fire from critics in Brussels, opponents at home and some lawmakers in her own party, has said talks on a divorce deal are at an impasse.

In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper ahead of her party’s conference, May took aim at those who have scorned her “Chequers” Brexit proposals accusing them of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest.

However, in a demonstration of the challenge she faces, the newspaper ran an interview with former foreign minister Boris Johnson alongside on its front page in which he openly questioned May’s commitment to Brexit and called her plans “deranged.”

“Unlike the prime minister I campaigned for Brexit,” said Johnson, the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed May who on Friday declined to answer directly whether he would rule out a leadership challenge.

“Unlike the prime minister I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.”

May says her “Chequers” proposals are the only viable option, but EU leaders have said parts of them are unacceptable and many Conservative lawmakers have threatened to vote down a deal based on May’s blueprint.

The uncertainty has led to business concerns that there will be no deal, potentially leading to tariffs and border delays.

Japanese carmaker Toyota (7203.T) on Saturday warned that leaving without an agreement would hit its production and jobs would ultimately be at risk.

“Of course we want a deal,” Business Secretary Greg Clark, one of those who supports May’s plans which seeks free trade of goods with the EU, told BBC radio.

“We need to have a deal. The evidence from not just Toyota and other manufacturers is we need absolutely to be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”

A summit of EU leaders last week ended in a blunt dismissal of May’s proposals, which they said would fail to resolve arguments over the land border of Northern Ireland, in the UK, with the Irish Republic, in the EU, one of the main sticking points to a deal.

Britain’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Irish issue was being used by some in the EU Commission “for political purposes”, but said he was open to suggestions from the bloc.

“We aren’t pretending there aren’t alternative proposals that we would look at,” he told the Sun newspaper. “But we need credible responses for the proposals we have set out or credible alternatives, and we haven’t seen them yet.”

FEARS OVER NO DEAL

As Conservative lawmakers and party members began arriving in Birmingham, central England, for what is expected to be a fractious party conference which starts on Sunday, many have said the Chequers plans are dead and should be torn up.

While May and government ministers continue to express confidence that a final Brexit deal can be agreed, they have also insisted no-deal would be better than a bad deal.

However, Toyota became the latest high-profile business to warn that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without any trading agreement could add costs and cripple output at plants which rely on the just-in-time delivery of tens of thousands of components.

“If we crash out of the EU at the end of March the supply chain will be impacted and we will see production stops in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota’s Burnaston plant, which produced 144,000 vehicles last year.

Earlier this week other carmakers in Britain including BMW, McLaren and Honda said they had triggered some contingency plans, such as certifying models in the EU, redrawing production schedules and stockpiling parts.

“The additional burden of import and export cost would add permanent costs to our business,” Toyota’s Cooke said. “It would reduce our competitiveness. Sadly I think that would reduce the number of cars made in the UK and that would cost jobs.”",Reuters,0

"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May called on her party on Sunday to unite behind her plan to leave the European Union, making a direct appeal to critics by saying their desire for a free trade deal was at the heart of her Brexit proposals.

At the start of what is set to be one of the Conservative Party’s stormiest annual conferences, May’s plans were once again attacked by two former ministers, with former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, calling them “deranged”.

Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, the debate over how to leave the bloc is still raging in the centre-right Conservative Party, and even in government.

May’s already fragile leadership was put under further pressure this month when the EU rejected parts of the so-called Chequers plan. But she put a positive spin on those talks, saying she was ready to consider the EU’s concerns.

“My message to my party is let’s come together and get the best deal for Britain,” May told the BBC in the central English city of Birmingham.

“At the heart of the Chequers plan is a free trade deal, a free trade area and frictionless trade ... Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote ... and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland.”

May has shown little sign of shifting away from her Chequers plan, named after her country residence where she hashed out an agreement on Brexit with her ministers in July, despite growing criticism that her proposals offer the worst of all worlds.

Johnson, who quit May’s cabinet after Chequers was agreed, called her plans “deranged” and attacked the prime minister for not believing in Brexit.

He, and the former Brexit minister David Davis, are pushing for a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU - a proposal May says will split Northern Ireland from mainland Britain by making the British province adhere to different customs rules.

Greg Clark, May’s business minister, said such a trade deal would also hurt businesses by clogging up international supply chains that are crucial to companies, such as car manufacturers.

BELIEVER

But Johnson was unrepentant, keen to portray himself as the defender of a clean break with the EU.

“Unlike the prime minister I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016,” Johnson, the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed May, told the Sunday Times newspaper.

Davis, who like Johnson resigned in protest said her plan was “just wrong”, but he added he thought it was 80-90 percent likely that the government would strike an exit deal with the EU.

Slideshow (8 Images)

May’s team had hoped the party’s conference would give her a platform to renew her pledge to help those people who are “just about managing”, trying to pull the focus away from Brexit and on to a domestic agenda.

But her first announcement - for an additional levy on foreign home buyers - did little to reset the conversation, with Sunday dominated again with Brexit, a possible leadership campaign and the prospect of an early election.

A report by a research group suggested Britain’s decision to leave the EU has cost the government 500 million pounds ($650 million) a week, wiping out for the moment any future savings from stopping payments to the bloc.

Ian Lavery, chairman of the opposition Labour Party, said the Conservatives were “clearly too busy fighting amongst themselves and have neither the ideas nor the desire to offer real solutions to the problems they have caused”.

Johnson’s interview in the Sunday Times was seen by many in the party to be the start of a campaign to unseat May - something that angered some Conservatives who are critical of the former foreign minister.

May refused to be drawn on his comments, and did not refer to him by name in a lengthy interview with the BBC. But her response was sharp.

“I do believe in Brexit,” she said.

“But crucially I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring that we make a success of Brexit for the future.”",Reuters,0

His remarks come down on the side of Prime Minister Theresa May in the debate dominating the fractious opening day of her Conservative Party annual conference — defining the best model for Britain’s future relationship with the EU.

Advocates of a more radical departure from the EU, led by potential leadership challenger Boris Johnson, want Britain to seek a deal based around the recent Canada-EU trade deal and which drops the government plan to apply EU regulations on trade.

But Clark, backing May’s so-called Chequers plan which calls for a ‘common rule book’ on trade, told an event that Britain was doing everything it could to allow international supply chains to flourish as it leaves the EU.

“One of the problems of the Canada model - the free trade agreement of that sort - is that it requires frictions at the border,” Clark said at the Huffington Post event.

He said it would set back national competitiveness and that it was no surprise that other countries were looking to snatch business away from Britain ahead of Brexit.

He was however confident of a deal that would allow the country to keep attracting manufacturing investment.",Reuters,0

The BelugaXL is based on the A330 and is formally designated the A330-700L.

Airbus is building five of the Rolls-Royce Trent 700-powered aircraft to replace its current fleet of A300-600ST, which are used to transport structural sections and wings to its assembly plants.

The technical document shows the layout of the four-seat courier area, aft of the cockpit, which has been designed for the BelugaXL. It comprises three seats on the right-hand side, and one on the left, either side of the cargo access point and an underside belly door.

Designed to carry pairs of A350 wings, the main-deck hold is 46.56m in length, with a 41.16m rollertrack. The BelugaXL also has an aft lower-deck freight compartment, capable of taking 14 LD3 containers, as well as a bulk cargo compartment behind it.",Flight Global,0
"Middle Eastern engine shop Turbine Services & Solutions has a unique position in the MRO sector.

Outside the Rolls-Royce network of wholly or part-owned Trent-series engine shops, TS&S is the sole maintenance provider that has full overhaul capability for the Airbus A330-powering Trent 700, acting chief executive Mansoor Janahi tells FlightGlobal.

In 2017, says Janahi, the Abu Dhabi-based company handled the first independent Trent 700 shop visit, involving an engine used by SriLankan Airlines; the vast majority of Trents are covered by R-R service agreements.

However, TS&S sees its role as a steadfast partner of, rather than competitor to, the engine manufacturers.

""We've got good relationships with all the OEMs, and our strategy is very much an OEM-led strategy,"" says Janahi.

He highlights that the Middle East has limited engine overhaul capacity despite the sizeable market presented by a fleet which has expanded rapidly. Much of the region's engine maintenance requirements are handled by service providers in Asia and Europe.

TS&S's role is to serve as ""gateway to the Middle East"" for engine OEMs, he says.

Janahi declines to disclose the company's revenue, but says the number of serviced engines has tripled since TS&S was established as a standalone engine overhaul provider in 2014.

Previously, the shop was part of Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies.

When that company's parent Mubadala restructured its MRO activities, ADAT's airframe and component repair activities were transferred to Etihad Airways, becoming the carrier's engineering division.

The engine shop was renamed, but remained under Mubadala ownership.

NEW CAPABILITIES

In addition to Trent 700s, TS&S supports GE Aviation GEnx powerplants, International Aero Engines V2500s, Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 turboprops and even industrial gas turbines, although the majority of its business is generated by aero engines.

Support for the GEnx was established after GE and Mubadala in 2013 disclosed an MRO partnership for the engine, variants of which power Boeing 787s and 747-8s.

Today, TS&S can complete quick-turn repairs on the GEnx. Janahi says the company is in discussion with GE to expand that capability to full overhauls, adding that this should happen ""ideally as soon as possible"".

In parallel with the GE co-operation, Mubadala in 2013 revealed a similar, separate partnership with R-R to service Airbus A350-powering Trent XWB engines.

Janahi says that while talks with R-R continue about the project, no timeline has yet been set for establishment of Trent XWB support capability.

The UK engine maker's recent efforts to increase MRO capacity – in order to deal with in-service issues affecting 787-powering Trent 1000s – have had no impact on TS&S's operations and future business plan, says Janahi.

He believes that the GEnx and Trent XWB represent a large enough business volume to sustain TS&S's future operations.

Meanwhile, the V2500 maintenance market is set for sustained expansion as a result of single-aisle fleet growth over recent years.

Janahi confirms, however, that TS&S is in talks with OEMs to establish capabilities for additional engines types. ""Hopefully there is more,"" he says.

He acknowledges that support of Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofans or the CFM International Leap series would represent a huge market with a broad base of potential customers.

The two engines – the Leap powers both the 737 Max and A320neo, while the PW1100G is an option on the Airbus aircraft – will be ""strong platforms"" in the region, he says.

Any new capabilities for TS&S would be added in partnership with an OEM, however.

Janahi rejects any notion that the overhaul shop might serve as a pure local-labour provider for the engine manufacturers.

He points to TS&S's ""very advanced"" MRO and testing capabilities that result in a ""very competitive… value proposition"".

Describing the facility as the Middle East's ""most advanced engine MRO"", he says TS&S's mission is not just to overhaul engines at required quality and turnaround time but to improve airlines' operation and overall performance.

""There are a handful of players today that have got the track record, qualification, people, knowledge, presence [and] a global customer base, [who] can do this here in the Middle East... The region is hungry for the OEM presence,"" says Janahi.",Flight Global,0
"The new batch of five Airbus A350-1000s ordered by Qatar Airways will be the longer-range version, featuring higher gross weights.

Airbus announced on 1 October that Qatar Airways had switched five of its existing A350-900 orders to the larger -1000 variant. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that the airline currently operates 34 aircraft of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-powered type: 30 -900s and four -1000s.

The switch, which increases the airline's A350-1000 total orders to 42 aircraft, will provide a better mix of aircraft capacities for its future fleet, Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker tells FlightGlobal.

""We feel that the -1000 is more efficient than the -900, and it fits into our capacity requirement. With the 787-9s [on order] and the A350-1000s, we have the exact fit.""

Al Baker says the ordered -1000s will be a new high-gross-weight version that Airbus has in development. The new batch will be delivered in 2020-21.

The manufacturer has declined to confirm any details of this new specification, but FlightGlobal understands that it features a 3-4t increase which will be available from around 2020.

With the current highest maximum take-off weight of 316t, the A350-1000 has a range of 8,400nm (15,540km). It is unclear how much additional range the increased weight will deliver, but Al Baker says the -1000 ""becomes a very potent aeroplane when that [new weight] happens"".",Flight Global,0
"Qatar Airways will start taking delivery of Airbus A321neos in 2020 but is yet to finalise the engine selection.

The airline's order for 50 A321neos resulted from its decision to abandon its launch order for the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered A320neo in the wake of the re-engined twinjet's early engine problems and production delays. Having proceeded with an order for the larger A321neo, Qatar Airways is still negotiating with both P&W and CFM International over the powerplant selection.

""We have signed a new purchase agreement with Airbus which will give us a mix of A321neos and A321LRs,"" says Qatar Airways group chief executive Akbar Al Baker.

He tells FlightGlobal that while the original contract with P&W for the PW1100G – dating from the A320neo order – ""is still valid... we are talking to both [engine suppliers]"". He adds: ""CFM is very keen to do business with Qatar Airways, and we have not made a final decision.""

Al Baker acknowledges that P&W is still suffering issues with its geared turbofan engine but says: ""We are very keen to work with Pratt. By 2020, when we receive our first aircraft, I'm very confident that Pratt will have resolved all the engine issues. For both Airbus and Pratt it is a very important issue that they need to resolve.""

The A321LR will give Qatar Airways flexibility to operate on ""thin intercontinental routes where we feel we need to reduce capacity during certain months of the year"", says Al Baker.",Flight Global,0

"Six decades ago today, on 4 October 1958, a BOAC de Havilland Comet 4 became the first jet airliner to fly revenue passenger services across the Atlantic, operating in each direction between London and New York. In achieving this feat, the UK long-haul flag carrier beat its great US rival Pan American, which was gearing up to be the first airline to operate a jet across the Atlantic with the Boeing 707.

BOAC is a forerunner of British Airways and the UK airline celebrated the transatlantic anniversary this week at its Waterside headquarters near Heathrow at an event attended by former Comet navigator Capt Hugh Dibley and one of the New York-London flight’s original cabin crew, Peggy Thorne - now aged 91.

British Airways

“It was marvellous” recalled Thorne (pictured above right with her BOAC colleagues). “We were used to travelling to New York on Boeing Stratocruisers which took up to 20 hours. We couldn’t believe the flight was possible in such a short time.

“Our customers loved it – they ate and drank from when they got on board until the time they got off.”

Capt Dibley, who joined BOAC just as the Comet 4 flew those historic inaugural crossings, went on to serve as navigator on the de Havilland jet. He subsequently spent many years as a pilot on the BOAC and BA Boeing fleets, firstly flying the 707 and later the 747 before flying the Lockheed TriStar.

FlightGlobal asked Capt Dibley about the great rivalry between those two 20th century airline icons as they raced to complete the historic world-first. And he explains how it would be the 707, rather than the pioneering Comet, that would go on to transform commercial aviation.

""Pan Am perceived themselves as the world leaders,"" says Capt Dibley. ""The BOAC Comet 4's debut really took the wind out of their sails!""",Flight Global,0

"EASA has established a process under which UK aviation companies holding European certification can apply for third-country approvals in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit.

Noting that government-level talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU are ongoing and that ""the final outcome of those negotiations cannot be pre-empted"", the European regulator states: ""This initiative is being launched in anticipation of a possible so-called 'no deal' scenario, which would result in the United Kingdom's effective withdrawal [from the EU] on 29 March 2019.

""However, in [the] case of a positive outcome to the negotiations, a transition period of 21 months until 31 December 2020 will be opened, during which everything will remain as it is today.""

On 2 October, EASA started accepting applications by UK approval holders for third-country certifications as part of ""possible preparedness measures"".

Aerospace manufacturing, maintenance and training organisations, along with aeromedical centres, can use the process to apply for third-country approvals.

Applicants will be charged fees.

As the UK's departure from the bloc and proposed transitional arrangements are still being negotiated, EASA says it ""cannot yet determine the ultimate impact of the withdrawal on EASA or its stakeholders"".

It warns, however, that Brexit will ""significantly alter EASA's co-operation with UK authorities and will not leave EASA's stakeholders untouched"".

Until its departure from the EU, the UK can ""fully"" participate in EASA activities and retains speaking and voting rights, says the European regulator, but it adds: ""After withdrawal the UK will cease to participate in the activities of EASA, and consequently the UK Civil Aviation Authority will no longer need to ensure compliance by UK-based companies with the EU aviation safety legislation.""

"Boeing-backed US hybrid-electric aircraft start-up Zunum Aero has selected Safran Helicopter Engines to supply a turboshaft engine to generate electric power for the propulsion of its in-development 12-seat commuter aircraft.

Safran says it will supply a new variant of its 1,700-2,000shp (1,270-1,500kW) Ardiden engine family – designated 3Z – which will be capable of delivering 500kW in combination with an electric generator.

The 12-seater – internally dubbed ZA10 – will also be equipped with battery packs to “supplement” electric power during “key stages of flight and over long ranges”.

Earlier this year, Seattle-based Zunum conducted ground tests of the hybrid-electric power system.

Safran says that ground trials will continue through 2019 – with the power system being “upgraded and tested in stages” – ahead of planned flight tests on a modified Rockwell Turbo Commander 840 in the second half of next year.

The high-wing twin-turboprop has a similar weight and performance to the ZA10 and has “excellent single-engine capability”, says Safran.

“The flying testbed will continue to be upgraded with successive prototype [power systems] until start of certification in 2020-2021,” it adds.

Zunum has a target of achieving a 610nm (1,130km) range for the ZA10 and a 60-80% operating cost advantage against comparable conventional aircraft.

Assuming that the hybrid-electric commercial aircraft can operate from small local airports, the type will facilitate “unprecedented door-to-door travel times that are two to four times faster than today”, says Safran.

The ZA10 will be the first of a planned regional hybrid-electric aircraft family. Zunum also proposes to deliver a 4MW-class, hybrid-electric airliner with about 50 seats before 2030.

"Ratings agency Moody’s has warned that a no-deal Brexit would be to the European aerospace and defence industry’s detriment, with smaller companies likely to be most severely affected in the short term.

In a market analysis released on 3 October, the agency says it expects the EU and UK to eventually reach an agreement that ""preserves many of their current trading arrangements"".

But vice-president and senior credit officer Jeanine Arnold states: ""The risk of a no-deal Brexit scenario is increasing and will remain a significant near-term threat to the aerospace and defence industry until a withdrawal agreement with transitional arrangements is signed.""

While admitting that it is ""hard to quantify the impact of a no-deal Brexit"", Moody's expects that ""trade disruption will pose a significant near-term risk"".

Potential new border checks could complicate the sector's highly integrated supply chain – which, the agency notes, is ""already strained"" as a result of a production ramp-up – and create additional costs for manufacturers by necessitating stockpiling of goods and management of customs procedures.

Increased trade barriers and restrictions on movement of people could meanwhile ""prompt aerospace and defence companies to consider changes to their manufacturing footprint [and] where to base their intellectual operations"".

Moody's does acknowledge that moving manufacturing operations to new locations would require long-term planning and that some companies might be able to ""wrangle concessions from governments to stay put"" while others prefer to ""wait and see the extent of any disruption that a no-deal Brexit might cause"".

But the agency adds: ""It is more probable that a no-deal Brexit will affect newer, long-term investments, such as Airbus's 'Wing of Tomorrow' programme.""

Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Leonardo are listed as the large manufacturers most affected by a no-deal Brexit, but Moody's foresees that smaller suppliers would be ""hardest hit… because they would lack the scale, resources and liquidity to manage abrupt swings in working capital, relocate personnel and manufacturing sites"".

It predicts that ""any moves [outside the UK] by larger aerospace and defense companies would most likely persuade smaller suppliers to follow suit due to the benefits of being in close proximity to their customers"".

While the UK's aim is to remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency, ""a no-deal Brexit scenario heightens the risk that it may be excluded"", Moody's argues.

Given that such an outcome would cause a ""substantially negative fallout"" for the aerospace sector across Europe, the ratings agency believes that the EU will ""take measures to limit this risk"".",Flight Global,0

"Hawaiian Airlines has finalised deals with General Electric to purchase at least 20 GEnx engines to power its Boeing 787-9s, and to have GE maintain those engines.

"Airbus has trimmed the backlog for the A319neo after a customer converted orders for three jets to the larger A320neo.

The original order, ascribed to an unidentified customer, was placed in December 2013.

Airbus’s backlog record shows that a single unnamed customer ordered 100 single-aisle jets, including 15 A319s.

The airframer’s latest update, covering the first nine months of this year, shows that three A319neos have been switched.

This trims the A319neo backlog to 53 aircraft, of which 30 are for undisclosed customers. Avianca is taking 20 while the other three are private or government airframes.

“FL Technics will be mainly engaged in aircraft maintenance & repair and technical support leveraging on its proven team, technical capabilities and management system.”

CALC says it will use its client networks and reach to aid the new venture. It adds that the new business will complement its existing disassembly and part-out service, and allow it to provide support for an aircraft’s full life cycle.

Though CALC does not cite aircraft types, it cites ICF International’s market forecast, which indicates that China’s narrowbody fleet is expected to grow 4.8% annually from 2017 to 2027, creating MRO demand for narrowbodies.

"Analysts are conducting acoustic and vibration tests of panels as part of the initial development effort for the shrunk version of the Sukhoi Superjet 100.

Sukhoi disclosed earlier this year that it was working to create a shorter variant of the Superjet, with just 75 seats.

The Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute states that it is performing assessment of ceiling and side panels of the larger Superjet in order to develop improved versions for the fuselage of the shorter aircraft.

It says that the analysis and testing, being conducted on behalf of Sukhoi Civil Aircraft, is intended to provide “increased acoustic comfort” within the passenger cabin.

Various insulation materials and coatings to absorb and dampen vibrations will be examined, as well as the properties of soundproof cladding used in both domestic- and foreign-built aircraft.

Project chief Alexander Zverev says that, since the original Superjet was designed, new materials have emerged.

“To assess their effectiveness, new measurements are required,” he adds. The institute will put forward recommendations as part of the technical documentation being drawn up for the Superjet 75.

Delta’s April 2016 commitment for up to 125 Bombardier CS100s - as the type was then designated, prior to Airbus’s 2018 takeover of the programme – was among the most contentious orders in recent years.

The order sparked a bitter protest from Boeing, which claimed that Bombardier, with the help of government subsidies, was dumping the CSeries in the US market. This led to US tariffs on the type that were ultimately struck down by the US International Trade Commission, allowing duty-free imports of CSeries.

"Boeing has made good on a promise to ramp up 737 deliveries, handing over 61 of the narrowbodies in September as it begins to recover lost ground.

The 61 737 handoffs in the month marks turn around for Boeing, which has struggled lately to get 737s out the door amid supply chain bottlenecks.

Chicago-based Boeing delivered 29 737s in July and 48 in August, figures well below the company's goal of handing over 52 of the aircraft monthly this year.

As 737 deliveries slowed in recent months, executives remained resolute, insisting Boeing had a recovery plan in place and that deliveries would increase in the later part of the year.

Deliveries of 787s also jumped to 18 aircraft in September, more than any in other month in at least the last year, according to Boeing's delivery reports.

Including September, Boeing has delivered a total of 568 commercial aircraft in 2018. The company must handover 242 more airframes by year end to achieve its total 2018 delivery target of 810 to 815 aircraft.",Flight Global,0
"Boeing has acquired aircraft parts and services provider KLX Inc, a move that furthers Boeing's goal of significantly boosting its aftermarket presence.

Boeing did not immediately confirm the price at which the deal closed, but previously said it intended to pay $4.25 billion for KLX.

The aircraft maker also said it intended to integrate KLX Aerospace Solutions, a division within KLX, into Aviall, a Boeing-owned parts and services provider.

KLX, which had been publicly traded, earned revenue of $1.7 billion in its most-current fiscal year, including $1.4 billion generated by its Aerospace Solutions Group. The company posted a net profit for that year, which ended in January, of $53 million.

KLX has some 2,000 employees and will remain headquartered in Miami, Boeing says. The deal will make Boeing ""a one-stop shop"" for parts and services, says Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing Global Services, in a media release. Boeing will also have greater access to parts and services for non-Boeing-built aircraft, it has said.

""The resulting boost in supply chain capability will allow us to better serve our customers while profitably and purposefully growing our business,"" Deal says.

""The acquisition positions Boeing to compete and win in the $2.8 trillion, 10-year aerospace services market,"" Boeing adds.

Boeing announced its intention to acquire KLX in May. At that time, Boeing said it intended to retire the name ""KLX Aerospace Solutions"" in early 2019.

Aftermarket expansion has been top among Boeing's recent priorities.

Boeing formerly offered aftermarket services independently through its commercial, defence and space and security units. But in November 2016 Boeing announced plans to merge all services work into the newly-created Boeing Global Services unit.

Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said the change placed the company on a path to generate $50 billion in services revenue in a decade.

It states that the overlaps between the two companies’ activities is “limited” because Boeing does not manufacture seats.

Adient develops and manufactures seating systems for cars and trucks but is not active in the production of aircraft seating.

Despite Boeing’s strong position in the production of civil aircraft, the transaction is “unlikely” to lead to competing seat manufacturers being “shut out” of the market, owing to the presence of three large players.

"Boeing has opted to withdraw a Swedish humidity-control system from the list of basic equipment on the 787 line.

The installation, known as Zonal Drying, has been “deselected” by the US airframer on the type, manufacturer CTT Systems states.

CTT had revealed in 2005 that Boeing would provide the Zonal Drying equipment as a standard fit for the 787 passenger cabin, with optional fit for the cockpit and crew rest.

The system was developed to save weight, and cut fuel-burn, by reducing condensation build-up.

CTT valued the agreement’s potential at around $250 million.

But it says that Boeing has chosen to remove the 787’s moisture-control system as basic equipment, adding: “The removal decision is consistent with other Boeing [aircraft] utilising crown ventilation via upper recirculation air.”

CTT admits the decision will have a “financial impact” on the Swedish company from the end of next year.

Supply of the equipment, and associated aftermarket sales, accounted for some 15-20% of its revenues over the course of last year and the first half of 2018.

Chief executive Torbjorn Johansson says the development is “unwanted” but points out that the Zonal Drying system is mainly aimed at the single-aisle aircraft market. The company will continue to act as an optional humidifier supplier for the 787’s cockpit and crew-rest area.",Flight Global,0
"An alleged Chinese intelligence officer has been extradited to the USA to face criminal charges related to a scheme to steal trade secrets from leading US aviation companies, including GE Aviation, says the US Department of Justice

Other unnamed US aerospace companies were also targeted by the conspiracy, which the US government says was directed by the government of China.

The alleged Chinese spy, Yanjun Xu (who goes by aliases Qu Hui and Zhang Hui), has been arrested by US officials after being extradited from Belgium, the US government says.

""This unprecedented extradition of a Chinese intelligence officer exposes the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States,” assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap says in a US Department of Justice media release.

Xu's attorneys, who work for Cincinnati law firm Taft Stettinius & Hollister, did not immediately respond to telephone calls requesting comment.

The FBI's Cincinnati division conducted the investigation. GE Aviation is based near Cincinnati.

Xu faces charges of conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and to steal trade secrets. Court documents suggest the alleged theft targeted technology related to engine fan blades and ""containment structures"".

""Xu targeted certain companies inside and outside the United States that are recognised as leaders in the aviation field. This included GE Aviation,"" says the Department of Justice release. ""He identified experts who worked for these companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise of asking them to deliver a university presentation.""

The US government says Xu is a deputy division director within a regional division of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. That agency conducts domestic and overseas espionage and is ""responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and political security"".

GE Aviation insists no military technology was targeted.

""For months, GE Aviation has cooperated with the FBI investigation which has resulted in a federal court case. The Chinese official in this case targeted a former GE Aviation employee,"" says GE Aviation in a statement. ""The impact to GE Aviation is minimal thanks to early detection, our advanced digital systems and internal processes, and our partnership with the FBI.""

""No sensitive information relating to military programs was targeted or obtained,” GE adds. ""The case did not involve a hack of GE information systems.""

The indictment says Xu represented himself as associated with the Jiangsu Science & Technology Promotion Association.

He sought specifically to obtain information related to advanced materials used in aviation engines, ""engine structural design analysis technology and manufacturing technology development"", says the US government's indictment.

""This case is not an isolated incident. It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense. We cannot tolerate a nation’s stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower,"" says US assistant attorney general for national security John Demers in the release.

The US government filed a criminal complaint against Xu in March, and he was arrested by Belgian officials on 1 April. The USA unsealed the charges against Xu on 10 October following his extradition to US soil, says the US government.

The economic espionage charges carry a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison, while charges for stealing trade secrets carry 10 years prison time, the US government says.",Flight Global,0
"Malaysian MRO firm Sepang Aircraft Engineering (SAE) says it will leverage on Airbus to achieve its goal of being a ""leading MRO"" in the Asia-Pacific.

SAE chief executive Pierre Reville tells FlightGlobal that this will achieved by deepening its partnership with the European airframer, as well as through upgrading of its employees' skills.

SAE, which became a fully-owned Airbus subsidiary in 2017, has also acquired the necessary approvals to perform engine changes for new-generation powerplants such as the CFM International LEAP-1A and Pratt & Whitney PW1100G that power the A320neo.

""This will be essential as we will soon need to meet the demand for this service from a growing number of A320neo customers in the region,"" says Reville. ""Being part of the Airbus customer services network allows us to tap into the company’s expertise in aircraft manufacturing, MRO, training and development. We can also be beneficiaries of the investment that the company is making in research and technology, especially in the MRO business.""

In terms of future capability, SAE is keen to grow its business on performing MRO checks for the A320-family and ATR fleets in Asia.

Reville lists up to eight new capabilities that SAE has developed: component and structural repair of radomes, cabin refurbishment upgrades, pilot seat repairs, propeller brake repair and de-icing boots for ATR turboprops.

However, he adds that SAE has performed some light checks on A330 aircraft, and that there is growing demand for B-checks on the widebody type.

""We are studying whether we should move into this area, but our current focus is still on narrow-body aircraft,"" he says.

On SAE's capacity, Reville says that the MRO may need two A320 docking bays in the near future, and could add more hangars in the mid-to-long term to cater for the space needed to perform heavy checks and increase its workload on the A330.

""Our hangars are very much full this year [and] our capacity expansion will come from shorter turnaround times for aircraft checks and improved efficiency. We still have a significant capability to grow.""

SAE has two hangars with a combined floor area of 49,000 square metres that can accommodate up to eight narrowbody aircraft. This year, it expects to deliver 120 C-checks, 25 aircraft paintings and about 200 radome repairs.

"Airbus’s decision to develop a lower-weight version of the new BelugaXL outsize freighter is based on consideration of airport and route charges.

FlightGlobal had previously disclosed that the BelugaXL – formally known as the A330-700L – will have a lighter variant, with a maximum take-off weight of 205t compared with the standard 227t.

Airbus says this variant, known as WV001, is intended to “minimise” airport landing and navigation charges.

Such fees are based on the declared maximum take-off weight declared in the aircraft’s flight manual, rather than the actual weight of the flight.

Airbus is constructing five BelugaXLs to replace the A300-600ST fleet, with the first aircraft being delivered next year.

BelugaXL programme chief Bertrand George has previously said that the fleet replacement effort needed to meet “very challenging” cost targets.",Flight Global,0
"Earlier this year, an employee at a major US aerospace company shared a company presentation marked ""proprietary"" with an alleged Chinese intellectual property spy.

The employee later shared more files, and the information transfer led to the extradition and arrest of the alleged spy, who authorities say was part of a corporate espionage campaign involving a top Chinese university and directed by the Chinese government.

A federal indictment and other court documents released 10 October describe how US officials believe the scheme worked. They say China sought technical aerospace information, including data about composite materials used in jet engine fan blades and engine cases.

GE Aviation, based in Ohio, was among the companies targeted.

The alleged spy, Yanjun Xu, sought to gain information by convincing engineers and other aerospace experts to share company information under the guise of an information ""exchange"" and giving university presentations.

Xu was extradited from Belgium to the USA on 9 October, where he was arrested by US officials and charged with conspiring to commit economic espionage and to steal trade secrets.

Xu is a deputy division director within a regional division of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, the US government says. Cincinnati-based attorneys representing Xu did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Court documents describe Xu as conspiring closely with an unnamed Chinese citizen ""believed to be a deputy director"" at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA).

That person has not been charged, US officials say.

The US government says the Chinese government's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology operates NUAA.

""NUAA is a regular collaborator with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) and Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), hosting academic and commercial seminars and symposium and sponsoring research published by academics from NUAA,"" court papers say.

As part of the alleged scheme, Xu and his colleagues targeted leading aviation companies, and identified employees at those companies who were experts in certain technologies.

Targets included an employee at ""Company A"", a ""top aircraft engine"" supplier based in southern Ohio, the indictment says.

That company invested billions of dollars researching composite materials in ""jet engine fan blades and fan containment structures"". It is also was ""the only company in the world that has been producing fan blades and encasements constructed of composite materials"", the indictment says.

Though court papers do not specify company names, a former GE Aviation employee was among those targeted, GE Aviation says. It declines further comment about the employee.

GE Aviation is also the only company that uses composite fan blades in commercial jet engines, it says. The blades are in GE90s, GEnx, GE9X and the CFM International Leap.

In 2017, the NUAA director invited Company A's employee to the university for an information ""exchange"", and the employee gave an aircraft engine presentation at the school in June last year.

Then in January the employee sent Xu an ""excerpt of presentation… pertaining to containment analysis for a fan blade encasement"". The presentation included a warning that it contained ""proprietary information"", the US government says.

The next month, the employee generated a ""file directory"" from a company computer, and sent it to Xu, the US charges.

During the course of the scheme, Xu specifically requested the employee provide information ""regarding the design criteria for… composite material rotor fan blade, stator fan blade and fan casing"", court papers say.

The US government alleges several other companies were targeted, including a manufacturer of commercial and defense aircraft.

Xu sought information related to wing and fuel systems on a military aircraft designed by that company, the US charges.

An employee from a third unnamed company sent Xu ""an outline of a proposed white paper discussing unmanned aerial vehicle technology"", court papers say. The scheme ended on 1 April, when Xu travelled to Belgium for a meeting where he planned to receive more company secrets.

Belgian officials arrested Xu and eventually extradited him to the USA.",Flight Global,0
"The planned joint venture between Boeing and Embraer would give the US manufacturer complete control over all aspects of Embraer's commercial aircraft unit, according to a recently-released document.

The document, a memorandum of understanding between Boeing and Embraer, also specifies that the deal would see Embraer's entire commercial unit transfer into a new, ""fully-integrated subsidiary"" of Boeing.

Embraer publicly released the document after it was reportedly leaked by one of Embraer's unions.

The nine-page agreement describes the corporate structure of Embraer's planned joint business with Boeing, including provisions intended to protect the value of Embraer's minority share.

It is dated 5 July – the day news broke that Boeing intends to acquire 80% of Embraer's commercial aircraft division, leaving the Brazilian manufacturer with 20%.

At the time, Boeing valued Embraer's commercial unit at $4.75 billion.

Executives have described the plan as an evolution of longstanding collaboration between the companies. Boeing's heft will help increase sales of Embraer's products and create new jobs, they had said.

The memorandum sets 5 December as the day by which much of the merger work will be complete, including Boeing's due diligence, finalisation of transaction documents, approval by company boards and filing of anti-trust immunity documents.

Embraer still expects the final deal will close by the end of 2019, it says.

The agreement specifies that, once closed, ""all aspects"" of Embraer's commercial aircraft division will transfer into a new company. Embraer's commercial business includes all commercial aircraft design, manufacturing, certification and sales, and Embraer's three commercial aircraft lines: ERJs, E-Jets and E-Jets E2, the document notes.

The new company will remain in Brazil, but Boeing will possess ""full strategic and operational control and management"", the agreement says.

Embraer's ""financial interests and stability… would receive protection by ensuring the ability to obtain cash flow"", the document says.

Embraer would receive unspecified cash payments for five years, after which the newly formed company would distribute to shareholders 50% of its profits.

Embraer and Boeing also intend to sign a ""lock-up agreement"", which would prohibit either company from selling their shares in the new company to an unaffiliated third party for 10 years.

The deal would also include a ""put option"" to ensure ""the value of Embraer's equity stake in [the new company] would be protected"", the document says.

That option would enable Embraer to sell any of its shares at the same per-share price paid by Boeing, plus an inflation adjustment,

"Guillaume Faury – named as successor to Airbus chief executive Tom Enders – has big paratrooper boots to fill. The former military man has achieved during six years as head of Europe’s aerospace behemoth what many believed could never happen. He brought a squabbling alliance of political and industrial egos under a single management, brand, and headquarters.

Airbus today is unrecognisable from EADS (even the name was unwieldy) – the turn-of-the-century project to unite the aerospace industries of France and Germany in a marriage of convenience to take on the might of Boeing in commercial aviation, and bring much of the nations’ military industrial firepower under one organisation. Enders must take much of the credit for that.

The German will formally hand over in April, but during his time in charge he has overseen much more than an organisational shake-up.

The decision to re-engine the A320 as the Neo saved billions of dollars in developing a new narrowbody family, and forced Boeing to follow suit with its 737 Max. The successful introduction of the A350 has ensured Airbus remains a contender in the widebody segment after the A380’s failure. A painful rationalisation of the defence and space businesses also has secured Airbus’s future in these markets.

There have been less auspicious moments. Bringing to production the A400M military transport has been a costly and convoluted exercise. The A380 and A330neo have failed to impress. And Enders’ dream of an even bigger European consolidation – a merger with BAE Systems – was shot down by wary politicians.

Aside from the problematic programmes, he bequeaths Faury (centre, below) a number of other challenges, not all of his making. He will depart just as the UK – which Airbus likes to call its fourth home country – leaves the EU, potentially creating a supply-chain tangle in the event of a no-deal Brexit: a prospect Enders describes as a “catastrophe”.

Airbus

Airbus – that we know of – has no direct answer to Boeing’s proposed New Mid-market Airplane, bar the long-legged A321LR, and the indifferent reaction to the A330neo could leave its US rival with three strong families in the long-haul market against Airbus’s one.

The company’s commercial arm is still getting over the retirement of long-serving super-salesman John Leahy and the resignation of former chief executive Fabrice Brégier, who former Airbus Helicopters chief Faury replaced.

Outside commercial aviation, helicopter sales globally are down and, while the logic of constrained defence budgets might demand a consolidation of Europe’s military aerospace industries, there seems to be little political appetite for Toulouse to swallow the likes of BAE, Dassault, Leonardo or Saab.

Faury has had a rapid ascent. Still running research and development for the then-Eurocopter as Enders was taking the controls at Airbus commercial a decade ago, the Frenchman was promoted from the helicopter division only earlier this year. He has six months of preparation to take on the biggest job of his life.",Flight Global,0

Speaking at NBAA 2018 today, Dassault Aviation executive vice president civil aircraft Olivier Villa said that the Falcon 6X’s PW812D powerplant is in flight and ground test with Pratt & Whitney Canada and the programme is on schedule for a first flight in 2021. “We will deliver the first aircraft in 2022,” he said.

BillyPix

The cabin mock-up is making its debut here at the show as Dassault outlines cabin options for the twinjet. Key programme partners are in place and detail design is progressing. The first metal has been cut for some components such as lower wing and rear fuselage parts.

Dassault Aviation chairman and chief executive Eric Trappier said he was encouraged to report that the market for pre-owned business jets is transitioning into “a sellers’ market”. “At the end of 2017, more than 30 used Falcon 7Xs were on the market. The inventory has shrunk by 50%.”

He expects this improvement in the pre-owned segment to be start to be reflected in demand for new aircraft. Trappier warns that Dassault is taking a “conservative” approach with production, targeting to deliver just one more Falcon this year than the 49 shipped in 2017.

"US aerospace suppliers L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation have disclosed plans to merge their businesses as the latest round of industry consolidation heats up.

The disclosure by the pair came days after aircraft component supplier TransDigm revealed its intention to acquire Esterline Technologies.

Harris and L3 describe their plan as a ""merger of equals"", under which the former's shareholders will own 54% of the combined company, with L3 shareholders controlling the remainder.

The combined business will be called L3 Harris Technologies and will be headquartered in Harris's home city of Melbourne, Florida, the two partners say. L3 is currently based in New York.

Together, the two manufacturers employ 48,000 people and foresee combined full-year revenues of around $16 billion in 2018, with a $2.4 billion operating profit.

Harris chief executive William Brown states the deal will create a ""premier global defence technology company"" and will ""accelerate innovation... deliver significant operating synergies and produce strong free cash flow"".

L3 Chairman Christopher Kubasik believes the merger ""creates greater benefits and growth opportunities than either company could have achieved alone"".

While the two sides describe their activities as ""complementary"", they say that cost savings will be generated through reducing direct and indirect spend, “rationalising footprint"", consolidating corporate and segment headquarters, establishing common IT and finance platforms, and further overhead reductions.

Some $450 million has been allocated for the changes up until 2021.

For that year, the two manufacturers target annual gross pre-tax cost synergies worth $500 million, which will translate into a net saving of $300 million.

The merger has yet to be approved by shareholders and regulatory authorities.

Meanwhile, TransDigm has disclosed that it will acquire the entire shareholding of aerospace and defence supplier Esterline.

Valued at around $4 billion, the transaction will be financed through cash and loans in about equal proportions, TransDigm and Esterline say.

Based in Bellevue near Seattle, Esterline employs around 12,500 staff and is forecast to generate revenue of around $2 billion across three core divisions in 2018: advanced materials; avionics and controls; and sensors and systems.

The two companies describe Esterline's product range as ""substantial content on many important commercial aircraft variants, many regional and business jet aircraft and major defence platforms"".

TransDigm executive chairman Nicholas Howley says: ""Esterline's core aerospace and defence business consists of primarily proprietary, sole source products with significant and growing aftermarket exposure.""

He adds that Esterline's capabilities are ""highly complementary"" to TransDigm's and that the acquisition will deliver ""private equity-like returns for our investors"".

The two deals are the latest in a wave of consolidation sweeping the industry. The largest transaction – United Technologies' $23 billion purchase of Rockwell Collins – is currently awaiting its final regulatory approvals.",Flight Global,0
"The business aircraft market should resume expansion in 2019 thanks to factors including US tax breaks, an improved used aircraft market and entry-into-service of several new business jets, according to Honeywell's latest market forecast.

The Global Business Aviation Outlook, released prior to NBAA, also shows surging demand for large business jets.

The Outlook, which takes into account economic factors, production plans and industry surveys, estimates that between 2019 and 2028 manufacturers will deliver 7,700 new business jets, roughly 50 more than Honeywell projected last year for the same 10-year period.

Those 7,700 aircraft will have an estimated market value of $251 billion, up 1-2% from last forecast.

For all the coverage from NBAA check out our dedicated event page

The recovery will not start this year; Honeywell expects deliveries in 2018 of new business jets will remain flat year on year, or perhaps decline slightly from last year's roughly 640 deliveries.

But Honeywell expects new aircraft deliveries will increase by 50-60 aircraft in 2019, a roughly 8-10% year-on-year jump.

""This is mainly due to first-year production of all these new aircraft that will enter service,"" says Honeywell's senior manager of marketing strategy Gaetan Handfield.

Indeed, Bombardier recently received Global 7500 certification, and it expects 5500 and 6500 certification in 2019. Textron Aviation expects imminent Cessna Citation Longitude certification, while Gulfstream Aerospace received G500 certification this year and expects G600 certification any time.

Of all new aircraft delivered in five years, North American customers will take an estimated 61%, while 16% will go to Europe and 12% will go to Latin America, where a slump in Mexico and Colombia offset Brazil's economic improvement, Gaetan says.

Asia-Pacific customers will take 7% of new jets in five years, and Middle East and African operators will take 4%, the Outlook shows.

Similar to last year's survey, operators intend to replace the equivalent of 20% of their fleets with new aircraft in the next five years.

Notably, European operators plan to replace 33% of their aircraft, a 14 point year-on-year jump that reflects at least two factors: UK and German market strength and easing of Brexit anxiety, Gaetan says.

The Outlook also shows surging interest in larger-cabin aircraft, a segment hit hard by the recession last decade. Those jets will account for an estimated 62% of units in the next five years, and 87% of sales value.

""It's the highest I've seen in a long time,"" Gaetan says, noting the share of large aircraft fell into the 40% range following the recession and has more recently been 50-55%.

He attributes the jump partly to recent US tax changes letting owners deduct, in the first year they own a business aircraft, 100% of its cost.

The Outlook also points to a tightening used-aircraft market, which suffered an inventory glut following the recession.

The number of for-sale ""recent model jets"" – those less than 10 years old – declined 30% in the last year, Honeywell says.

""It means we are turning the corner,"" says Gaetan. ""It means that pricing should start going up on the used market.""

As used aircraft prices climb, new aircraft become more attractive.

""I think that's what we are going to see over the next two years – more buyers transitioning from the used market to the new,"" Gaetan says.",Flight Global,0
"Rolls-Royce is celebrating its 60th anniversary in business aviation at NBAA, having first entered the sector in 1958 powering the Gulfstream I with the Dart turboprop.

The UK engine maker reaffirmed its commitment to the business aviation world with the recent launch of the Pearl 15 turbofan to power Bombardier’s Global 5500 and Global 6500 superwide cabin business jets.

R-R has delivered more than 7,000 engines in the business aviation market, powering aircraft such the early HS125s and Gulfstreams, as well as the Bombardier Global series. Today about 3,000 of these aircraft are in service worldwide. The first member of the latest addition, the Pearl 15, received European certification on 28 February.

The Pearl trial programme has completed 10,000 test cycles in over 2,600 testing hours to date. Six Pearl 15 development engines with 14 builds have been used in 27 test campaigns. These include tests under extreme icing conditions, massive water ingestions, lightning strikes and long-lasting maturity runs.

The Dahlewitz site in Germany has begun building the first production standard engines and is preparing for the production ramp-up. Maturity testing is on track to support a service-entry at the end of 2019.

Rolls-Royce has further expanded its global network of Authorised Service Centres (ASC) for its CorporateCare customers.

"Honeywell is highlighting changes to several maintenance and connectivity products – tweaks the company says give customers better control over onboard data usage, helping them cut costs.

The company has shifted its maintenance service plan to a ""usage-based"" model under which Honeywell will give customers engine maintenance discounts up to 10%.

Discounts will reflect flight factors that reduce engine wear, such as flight length and throttle settings, Honeywell says.

Customers can track performance and maintenance savings via Honeywell's GoDirect maintenance portal, it says.

Likewise, customers who use Honeywell's JetConnex in-flight connectivity system can use the GoDirect Data Control system to slash an average of 30% from data usage costs, Honeywell says.

GoDirect Data Control predicts how much data an aircraft will use in flight, which can let operators chose the most economic data package.

"Aviation technology company Astronics has brought to NBAA a new cabin demonstration booth to showcase about 30 cabin technologies.

Those include a cabin control system that lets passengers manipulate a range of cabin functions via a wireless touchscreen device about the size of a smartphone.

The device can control in-flight entertainment, cabin lights and window shades, and passengers can use it to make telephone calls to the ground, Astronics says.

Astronics is promoting ""LiFi"", new technology that uses LED lights to transmit data via the visible light spectrum. Wi-fi, by comparison, transfers data via radio waves.

Though not yet widely used, LiFi can transmit data at higher speeds than other technologies. It could be used, for example, to download or upload data from aircraft on the ground, the company says.

Separately, Astronics has received ""parts manufacturer approvals"" from the Federal Aviation Administration for LED landing and taxi lights on a variety of business aircraft. Its LED lights have average time between unscheduled maintenance of some 30,000h, the company says.

Additionally, American aircraft manufacturer Sikorsky recently installed Astronics' ""Max-Viz 2300 Enhanced Vision System"" on an S-76D chopper.

"An in-flight shutdown of a GoAir operated Airbus A320neo on 8 February 2017 has been traced back to the improper assembly of a component in one of its Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines.

The incident occurred on an aircraft registered VT-WGB, as it was taking off 19:31 local time on a flight from Delhi to Bengaluru, the Director General of Civil Aviation’s final report states.

During the take-off, the aircraft’s master warning sounded, along with and the electronic centralised aircraft monitor displayed a low oil pressure message, followed soon after by a notification that the left-hand engine had failed.

Soon after, the crew initiated a ""pan"" call and the aircraft returned Delhi. There were no reports of injuries among the 187 passengers and six crew onboard.

During inspection, an oil leak was observed from the exhaust of the affected engine, with oil splashes found around the area. Metal chips were also found in main gear box chip detector.

In its investigation, the DGCA found that the aircraft had been dispatched with an ""oil chip detected"" alert in the left-hand engine. In accordance with Airbus procedures, an engineering approval allowed the aircraft to be flown for 10 flight hours for the total engine run time.

During a teardown inspection of the failed engine, it was found that the permanent magnetic alternator (PMA) rotor was ""installed out-of-position axially and circumferentially"" on the PMA gear shaft. This generated foreign object debris over time and resulted in the chip warning and the subsequent engine shutdown.

DGCA says it may take up the matter with P&W regarding the error during assembly stage of the engine.

"Satellite communications company Iridium Communications is using NBAA to highlight its new satellite network and a Thales-made aircraft antenna.

The antenna, a shoe-sized device called FlytLink, is the smallest antenna of its kind, and connects to the company's L-band satellite network, says Iridium executive vice-president of sales and marketing Bryan Hartin.

Iridium's competitive edge rests not on data transfer speeds, but rather the complete worldwide coverage of its satellite constellation. Nowhere on earth sits outside Iridium's coverage, executives say.

That constellation consists of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites.

Iridium has nearly completed set up of a new satellite constellation called Iridium Certus. The company has launched 66 of those satellites and plans a final launch to complete the constellation in the fourth quarter.

"UTC Aerospace Systems will supply the deicing system on Textron Aviation's in-development Cessna SkyCourier, an aircraft Textron says will first fly in 2019.

The aircraft will have UTC's Goodrich-branded, pneumatic-inflated rubber deicing boots on critical flight surfaces like wings and tail, says UTC vice-president of business development Mark Skarohlid.

Textron is developing the twin Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-65SC-powered SkyCourier as a freighter and passenger aircraft.

FedEx has already ordered up to 100 of the aircraft, which Textron expects will receive certification in 2020.

The deicing system will use inflatable rubber boots made of UTC's ""Estane"" surface material, which the company says provides improved protection against cold-induced cracking and degradation caused by aircraft fluids, ultraviolet light and ozone.

The system will come with a pressure-sensitive adhesive that allows operators to fly the aircraft within 2h of installation, says UTC, noting that other adhesives can require 48h dry time.

The system will also have sensors that notify pilots of icing conditions, Skarohlid says.

The boots can last up to 15 years before requiring replacement, though the useful life depends on aircraft type and mission, the company says.

UTC's deicing systems are certified on some 200 aircraft types, including general aviation aircraft and regional jets.

"Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance sees scope for wider application of its predictive maintenance software, originally developed to tackle specific issues in its parent group's fleet.

The MRO provider made a deliberate choice to concentrate on analysing technical data from specific components and systems, rather than assessing a broad range of aircraft onboard data, AFI KLM E&M vice-president digital Jacques-Olivier Guichard tells FlightGlobal.

Speaking at the MRO Europe convention on 17 October, Guichard argued that this approach enabled the MRO provider to examine the ""full depth of data"" for particular equipment and ""really follow a system to the end"".

Technical issues with the fuel systems on Air France's Airbus A380s were among the first issues to be analysed with AFI KLM E&M's Prognos software, as they were known to cause disruptions to the airline's operations.

Predictive maintenance applications were developed for a total of five systems on the A380, including landing-gear components and the supplemental cooling system.

Meanwhile, the MRO provider has developed additional applications for landing gear and pneumatic components on A320s and A330s, and for other equipment on Boeing 787s.

In order to prove the concept on legacy aircraft, AFI KLM E&M developed a predictive maintenance tool for the 747 before Air France retired that type in early 2016.

As a result of these projects, AFI KLM E&M's digital engineering team has matured a predictive algorithm that – in its basic form – can be reused and adapted for different systems on different aircraft, says Guichard.

"Signs at this year’s NBAA convention proclaimed: “The future of business aviation starts here.” For once, there were plenty of indications that 2018 could be a turning point for the sector – 10 harrowing years after the financial crisis – and particularly in its largest market, the USA.

Honeywell’s annual NBAA forecast is rarely downbeat – it is in the engines-to-avionics maker’s interest to predict healthy demand for business jets and the ­products they need to fly. This year, its outlook was particularly rosy, with healthy economies and new programmes spurring demand for 7,700 aircraft by 2028 – a rise of 50 units on last year’s prediction.

With their theme parks and mega casinos, Orlando and Las Vegas – alternating hosts of NBAA – are far removed from real America. However, from Wall Street to Walmart, there is evidence of growing corporate and consumer confidence. Healthy balance sheets and optimism help unlock spending on corporate jet travel.

Another important spur for new aircraft orders is a reduction in the inventory of used equipment for sale. After a period in which many owners of two- to five-year-old business jets would gladly have sold up for a fraction of the manufacturer’s list price, that glut of nearly new aircraft is diminishing.

At the same time, there are more programmes in development than since the heady pre-2008 days, when it was hard to keep up with all the very-light-jet projects. This time, the focus is on heavier metal, with around a dozen programmes or variants in the super-midsize segment and above set to enter service in the next five years.

Simultaneously, electrically powered air transport is moving closer to reality, with Safran and Uber both revealing details about alternative-propulsion projects.

There are dark clouds, of course: the threat of a pilot recruitment crisis for a growing industry, and ongoing problems in Brazil, Russia, India and China, whose orders for large jets helped the industry weather the worst of the storm after 2008.

"Airbus plans to approximately triple the fleet covered by its digital services platform Skywise by the end of 2019.

Senior vice-president digital solutions Norman Baker said at the MRO Europe convention in Amsterdam on 17 October that Airbus was aiming to have around 100 Skywise airline customers, with a total fleet of 10,000 aircraft under contract, by the end of the period.

Today, 28 airlines with a total fleet of some 3,500 aircraft have subscribed to the platform, he says. Earlier this month, Delta Air Lines was recruited as an additional Skywise customer to support its A320 and A330 fleets.

Baker declined to disclose business volume in revenue terms.

He says the airframer has been able to substantially shorten project lead times through a ""very strong transformational shift"" in the way software development programs are being approached.

In the past, he says, Airbus required, on average, between 18 months and two years to develop software solutions requested by airlines. However, by the time they were ready to be rolled out, they were frequently obsolete.

In January, he says, Airbus adopted an ""appropriation mode"" under which the manufacturer develops solutions together with the customer, and early product iterations are used for testing and potential further development.

Using this method, a predictive maintenance tool was developed within 10 weeks, he says.

In order to foster development and grow its digital services business, Airbus earlier this month opened a dedicated facility in Toulouse. The team there will comprise some 800 people.

In June, Airbus unveiled an aircraft reliability analysis software package for Skywise, through which airlines can examine potential technical issues on their aircraft in context with real-time fleet operational data, maintenance records and spare-parts information.

The software ""allows users to drill down into trends to truly diagnose root causes so they can allocate resources to mitigate recurring operational interruptions"", Airbus says.

It adds that the system also provides access to ""worldwide anonymised fleet data so that airlines can proactively assess reliability performance against industry benchmarks"".

While the present system concentrates on analysing the technical status quo of aircraft, the next generation will enable users to assess the effectiveness of maintenance actions.

In 2019, the manufacturer will introduce an aircraft health monitoring tool for Skywise, which serves as a replacement for Airbus's existing Airman solution, says Baker.

The new system is currently being tested and has been shown to handle 600,000 data occurrences within 0.1s, while Airman is capable of handling 7,000 events with a 30s response time, he says.

The former employees allegedly stole the secrets by emailing documents from their Bombardier email accounts to personal accounts in the days and hours before leaving their jobs, Bombardier says.

The suit names several former staffers who it says were involved. Those include Bombardier's former senior engineering specialist for flight controls Laurus Basson, former aircraft performance engineer Cindy Dorneval, former aerospace engineer Keith Ayre, former aircraft engineering specialist Marc-Antoine Delarche and former director of CSeries flight test teams Michel Korwin-Szymanowski.

Those former staffers took jobs at AeroTEC, with the exception of Ayre, who took a job at Mitsubishi Aircraft, according to the suit and LinkedIn profiles.

The alleged thefts occurred in 2016 and 2017.

""We have strong evidence to support that Bombardier trade secrets were misappropriated and are being used for the certification of the MRJ regional jet,"" Bombardier tells FlightGlobal. ""Bombardier does not take these actions regarding its trade secrets lightly and is taking all the necessary steps to protect its intellectual property.""

The suit requests Mitsubishi Aircraft, AeroTEC and staff be prohibited from continuing to use proprietary information or from recruiting Bombardier staff in order to obtain secrets.

Bombardier seeks punitive damages and disgorgement of wrongful profits, but does not specify dollar amounts.

""Our immediate priority is to put an end to the misappropriation of our trade secrets,"" Bombardier tells Flightglobal.

Mitsubishi Aircraft contests the allegations.

“We believe the allegations to be unfounded and find no merit in their assertions,” the company tells FlightGlobal. “We look forward to the opportunity to prove this during the legal proceedings.”

AeroTEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

His remarks came as the low-cost airline posted a 7pc fall in half-year profits - an announcement that had the hallmarks of a classic corporate “kitchen-sinking”.

Staff and maintenance costs in the six months to September spiked by around a third; fuel costs were 21pc higher. Fares were on average 3pc lower, and the airline warned a further 2pc reduction over the winter is on the cards. The Government’s handling of Brexit, which some continue to argue will ground flights in March if an agreement cannot be struck, was blasted as a “shambles” by O’Leary.

"Korea Aerospace Industries’ (KAI) MRO unit, Korean Aviation Engineering & Maintenance Service (KAEMS), will induct its first aircraft for heavy maintenance in December.

Responding to queries by FlightGlobal, KAI adds that this will start with a Boeing 737 NG operated by a local low-cost carrier. In 2019, KAEMS will look to service Airbus A320s, as well as 787s.

Headquartered in Sacheon in the South Gyeongsang province, KAEMS will look to provide heavy C to D checks as its main business. However, it will then expand the portfolio to include component maintenance, supply chain management and line maintenance.

KAEMS will use an existing KAI hangar that was formerly used for military MRO and upgrades. The hangar will be able to accommodate up to two narrowbody aircraft.

On future capacity expansion, KAEMS will build a new hangar that will have the capacity to hold either one widebody aircraft or two narrowbodies, or up to five narrowbodies. However, the company did not detail the timeline for expansion plans.

KAI reveals that KAEMS has not yet obtained an Approved Maintenance Organisation certificate from the country’s ministry of land, infrastructure and transport. KAEMS had applied for the relevant approvals in September and expects to be approved “by November at the latest”.

Launched in July, KAEMS is a joint venture between KAI and Korea Airport Corporation (KAC), with minor investments from Jeju Air, Eastar Jet, Unical Aviation, BNK Financial Group, Hizeaero and A-Tech.

KAEMS is confident of success as the newest MRO entrant into the Korean maintenance market.

“Although Korea is not a rapidly growing market like China or South east Asia, KAEMS sees an up-tick of 4% CAGR until 2030 thanks to the growing LCC demands. [More importantly], Korea [has] never have had a [third-party] MRO company,” says KAI.

“Despite the growing airline needs, full-service carriers have focused on providing service for their own fleet, therefore, all the LCC MRO had to go international. Korean FSCs are suffering from high-costs on their in-house maintenance, [and] LCCs still require domestic MRO sources for their fleet services.”

"Pratt & Whitney remains on target to hit its 2018 commercial aircraft engine delivery commitments despite output sagging in the third quarter, say executives at parent company United Technologies.

""Pratt & Whitney remains on track to meet its full-year customer delivery commitments and to approximately double [geared turbofan] production from 2017,"" said UTC vice-president of investor relations Carroll Lane during a third-quarter earnings call on 23 October.

""Total geared turbofan shipments, including those to the spare engine pool, continued to increase sequentially and grew significantly over the prior year third quarter,"" he adds.

However, deliveries of large commercial engines fell to 198 in the third quarter, down from 210 in the previous three-month period, UTC says.

That decrease largely reflects a slowing of deliveries of earlier-generation International Aero Engines V2500s, production of which is declining as demand for new PW1000G geared turbofans (GFT) increases, P&W tells FlightGlobal.

Shipments of geared turbofans ""saw no significant change"" between the second and third quarter, it says.

The third-quarter deliveries bring to 532 the number of large commercial engines delivered by P&W over the first nine months of 2018.

That figure includes both the PW1000Gs and V2500s, though UTC does not break out engine models.

But Airbus delivered 47 V2500-powered A320s during the first nine months of 2018, suggesting P&W may have handed over about 440 GTFs in the period, the majority of which were for the A320neo, but also included engines for the A220 and Embraer E190-E2.

P&W delivered 374 geared turbofan engines last year, giving a 2018 target of around 750 units.

The propulsion specialist has been under pressure to ramp up GTF deliveries in line with increased output of A320neos. The company has also suffered delivery delays due to supply chain shortages and technical problems.

P&W's sales surged 24% year-on-year in the third quarter, to $4.8 billion, but operating profit slid 42% to $109 million.

Third-quarter sales at sister company UTC Aerospace Systems climbed 9% year on year, to $4 billion, while operating profit increased 7%, to $610 million.

"The chief executive of United Technologies has suggested his company's participation in Boeing's proposed New Mid-Market Airplane (NMA) is not a sure thing, citing the Seattle airframer's continued supply-chain squeeze.

""We would obviously like to have a position on that aircraft, but it has to make sense,"" UTC chief executive Gregory Hayes says on 22 October. ""The investments have to have a payoff based on what we think the market… size is.""

""They have some pretty tough cost targets out there, but they are optimistic about the market size,"" he adds of Boeing.

Boeing has for several years been seeking to cut supply chain expenses through its ""partnership for success"" programme, which the company launched in 2011.

Cost cutting efforts have led Boeing to bring some work in house, such as nacelle and propulsion system work. It has also handed work to new, smaller suppliers like Héroux-Devtek, which beat out incumbent UTC Aerospace Systems to supply 777X landing gears.

Boeing's has pitched the NMA as a 220-270-seat aircraft with a range of up to 5,000nm (9,260km). The company will make a decision in 2019 about whether to launch the aircraft, executives have said.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus insists the maiden flight of its A330-800 will be conducted “in the near future”, after the aircraft emerged with its engines installed.

The aircraft – the smaller of the two A330neo family members – was painted in the airframer’s house colours in February this year, without its Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines fitted.

Airbus has been focused on certifying the larger A330-900, which is awaiting delivery to TAP Portugal following European Aviation Safety Agency approval.

The airframer says it has yet to firm a date for the -800’s first flight. Its initial test aircraft, MSN1888, is registered F-WTTO.

Airbus gives a standard seating capacity of 257 for the twinjet, slightly higher than that for the A330-200 on which the re-engined airframe is based.

The -800’s sales have been far weaker than those for the -900, which has landed 224 orders.

Airbus had obtained orders from Hawaiian Airlines and TransAsia Airways for the -800 before both carriers, for separate reasons, cancelled their commitments.

While the airframer’s backlog to the end of September still does not list any firm orders for the -800, the company has recently received a commitment from Kuwait Airways for eight.

Partner Safran states that the third-quarter performance meant that its total Leap deliveries over the first nine months reached 741 – a rise of nearly 2.9 times.

Its combined output of 1,575 Leap and CFM56 engines is 18% up on last year, although the figure also indicates that CFM56 deliveries fell to 834 – a decline of 22%.

CFM56 deliveries were down by one-third, to 243, in the third quarter.

"Boeing has become the latest major aerospace company to insist it is recovering from supply chain issues that have roiled the industry and left unfinished 737s piling up outside Boeing's Renton production facility.

""The 737 programme continues to make good progress on its recovery… to overcome supply chain challenges, with 61 aircraft delivered in September,"" Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg says on 24 October. ""We expect to recover the 737 line by the end of the year, with fourth quarter deliveries expected to be above the [target] production rate.""

The company maintains its goal of delivering 810 to 815 commercial aircraft in 2018.

Shortages of supplies from 737 fuselage-maker Spirit AeroSystems and engine maker CFM International hit Boeing earlier this year, as it was increasing 737 production from 47 to 52 aircraft monthly. Deliveries of 737s plunged to 29 aircraft in July, but have since recovered.

""We now have fuselages being delivered to our purchase order plans,"" Muilenburg says. ""We have had some engine recovery… We see engine recovery by the end of the year.""

Muilenburg says production has also been complicated this year because Boeing is manufacturing both 737NG and 737 Max aircraft. That issue should ease next year as 737NG production dries up.

The recovery cannot come soon enough, as Boeing intends to boost 737 production again next year, to 57 aircraft monthly, to clear a 4,700-aircraft backlog.

Muilenburg's comments came as Boeing announced earning a third quarter net profit of $2.4 billion, up 31% year-on-year. Third quarter revenue inched up 3.8% to $25 billion.

The commercial airplane unit generated third quarter revenue of $15.3 billion, flat year-on-year, and operating profit of $2 billion, up 34% in one year,

Newly-formed Boeing Global Services generated $4.1 billion in third quarter revenue, up 14% in one year, and a $543 million profit, up 10%.

Boeing delivered 190 commercial aircraft in the third quarter, including 138 737s (81 737NGs and 57 737 Max), two 747-8s, four 767s, 12 777s and 34 787s, it says.

Supply chain aside, Muilenburg painted an uplifting picture of Boeing's commercial business, saying airline profits and worldwide demand for air travel remains strong, driven by an increasingly-mobile middle class.

Boeing landed new orders in the third quarter for 171 commercial aircraft, worth $13 billion, bringing its total commercial aircraft backlog to 5,800 aircraft, worth $413 billion. That equates to seven years of production, Boeing says.

Muilenburg stresses Boeing continues to push forward with 777X development, having completed production of the static test aircraft and starting production of flight test aircraft.

Boeing remains on track to begin 777X flight testing in 2019, followed by the first delivery in 2020, Boeing says. The company has orders and commitments for 340 777X aircraft.

"United Technologies expects Chinese regulators will soon approve its planned $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins despite recent souring of US-China trade relations.

""We are still within our expected timing range for China. We don't see any drama here, and we continue to expect this to happen shortly,"" UTC chief executive Gregory Hayes says on 22 October. ""We're still on track… Whether this takes another week or two weeks, I'm not all that concerned.""

Hayes reiterates that he expects China's approval will come within weeks of the DOJ's approval, which was conditionally cleared on 1 October - later than Rockwell anticipated.

US regulators gave the green light for the deal on the condition that UTC divest two Rockwell divisions: one that makes pneumatic aircraft deicing systems, and another that makes horizontal stabiliser actuators.

As the approval process progressed, however, US-China trade relations strained amid new tariffs and tariff threats.

Hayes though believes such tension will not disrupt the Rockwell deal.

""We have heard nothing from the… the regulatory agency that approves these transactions that would cause us to believe there's any political issue that's holding up the approval of our deal,"" he says. ""There's a lot going on geopolitically, there's a lot of tension between the US and China. We just don't see that as impacting the deal.""

With the acquisition, UTC intends to merge its systems and electronics businesses into Rockwell's cockpit and cabin products units to create Collins Aerospace Systems.

Speaking ahead of an opening event, Jenette Ramos, Boeing senior vice-president manufacturing, supply chain and operations, said the airframer had ""many projects and operations in-country"" which had to be viewed ""in combination"".

""We have been very supportive of the UK's prosperity agenda,"" she says, pointing to previous investments across its portfolio. ""This adds a manufacturing presence.""

She adds that the Sheffield operation is an ""amazing investment in the development of people"" allowing the UK to make ""complex hardware"" to feed Boeing's supply chain.

A total of 13 specific suppliers from the region around Sheffield have been ""activated"" to contribute to the programme, she says.

Manufacturing of components for the 767 has already commenced, with operations for the 737 due to begin ""in the coming weeks"". Full-rate production will be achieved by year-end.

Parts built in Sheffield are shipped to Boeing Fabrications' plant in Portland, Oregon for assembly, and will be installed on aircraft from 2019.

At the moment the actuators are outsourced, but Boeing is bringing the work in-house. Ramos denies the move is due to any issues with its existing supplier.

"Thai Airways International is concerned about the reputational damage caused by persistent engine issues with its Boeing 787-8 fleet.

Four of the carrier’s eight 787-8s are ground awaiting spare parts for their Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, says Krittaphon Chantalitanon, vice-president of alliances and commercial strategy at Thai.

“We have to do a lot of schedule changing,” he says. “There have been some delays and we will extend the phasing out period of certain types of aircraft, namely the 747-400 and possibly earlier versions of the 777, the -200s and non-ER -300s.”

The airline is in discussion with R-R regarding compensation, but Chantalitanon feels that money is not the entire issue.

“Compensation is one thing, but the impact, to be polite, to the brand, for customer satisfaction, and everything that comes with it, is relative to the compensation. I'm more concerned with the impact to the brand and everything else rather than the ultimate financial figures.”

Issues with the both intermediate-pressure turbine and IP compressor blades in the Trent 1000 have been an problem with both Thai and other operaters throughout the world, periodically grounding portions of the world’s Trent-powered 787 fleet.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that Thai operates six 787-8s and two -9s. Its eight 747-400s have an average age of 19.6 years, its five 777-200s 21.8 years, and its six 777-300s 19 years.

“Rolls have been very accommodating for a lot of the issues, but the matter remains unresolved. At the moment we have four 787-8s grounded, which comprise fifty percent of our Dreamliner fleet. We are working together with Rolls to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, but you never know if [aircraft five will be grounded].”

Chantalitanon made the remarks in an interview with FlightGlobal at the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) Assembly of Presidents, which was held recently on the resort island of Jeju, South Korea.

"Boeing continues to explore the issues and possibilities around its New Mid-market Airplane (NMA), with its sights still firm on a potential 2025 service entry.

Since the Farnborough Airshow in July, the programme has had a relatively low profile, but Boeing's vice-president of marketing Randy Tinseth says that work is continuing behind the scenes.

“[There is] not a lot to report because our team has their heads down and they're working hard on production systems, working hard on the business case, and we still plan on making a programme decision next year,” he says.

Tinseth adds that once a launch decision is made, the company will be “working hard” to maintain the proposed 2025 service entry date.He notes that widebody and narrowbody replacement demand will start picking up from 2019, potentially creating an opportunity for the new aircraft, which would fit between the 737 Max 10 and 787-8.

The proposed concept for a 200-270-seat family of aircraft with 4,000-5,000nm range has been on Boeing's drawing board since 2012. At Farnborough, the company said a launch decision was between six and 18 months away.

Tinseth reiterated Boeing’s contention that the type will offer “widebody comfort with single aisle economics.”

He made the remarks in an interview with FlightGlobal at the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) Assembly of Presidents, which was held recently on the resort island of Jeju, South Korea.

A number of AAPA’s members are major cargo operators such as Korean Air, Cathay Pacific and China Airlines. It has been reported that some Asia-Pacific carriers are focused on the NMA's cargo carrying capability, while North American carriers are considerably less concerned with this.

Tinseth, however, downplays the apparent divergence of views.

“The airplane is going to carry cargo, but it's not going to be a widebody aircraft the way you think about it,” he says. “A widebody has a structure that's built to carry those big containers, and there is a cost associated with that, and it's not insignificant. We ask our customers whether they want to carry those big containers or have better economics through saving weight. It's pretty close to unanimous that they want the most efficient aircraft.”

Boeing has previously suggested an aircraft with a hybrid fuselage cross-section, which is generally taken to mean a wider passenger cabin and a narrower cargo bay.

On the engine for the aircraft, Tinseth says the company continues to evaluate the engines, though he declined to discuss specific details.

“We have to make a decision about the technology and what it does for the performance of the aircraft,” he says. “Do you need one or more engine suppliers? All of those questions are being addressed now.”",Flight Global,0

What sparked your interest in aerospace and aviation?

My parents took me to an air show at RAF Church Fenton when I was nine years old, and from that moment I was hooked. I spent several years as a teenager in the air training corps where I learned everything from the principles of flight to air navigation. I also had regular opportunities to fly the De Havilland Chipmunk, amongst other types. I spent many of my summer holidays at a variety of RAF camps, where I became fascinated by every aspect of their operation, from flying to airspace management and maintenance. I initially studied History at University and then elected to follow it up with an MA in Defense Analysis at Lancaster in 1999. During that time I used my dissertation to assess the export potential of the Eurofighter with a view to pursuing a career in the aerospace industry.

How has your career progressed?

I went straight from University in BAE Systems where I joined their direct entry graduate programme. During my first two years I was assigned to their commercial aircraft division and given the opportunity to work in a variety of procurement and commercial roles across the Airbus group. I stayed with Airbus after BAE divested their share and worked in a number of full-time roles where I was a member of the Airbus e-business project team and then the A400M wing design and development group. I had a brief spell at Hamilton Sundstrand where I worked in a procurement role. This exposed me to some of the real nitty-gritty of daily supply chain management and politically sensitive workshare arrangements. I made the big switch from suppliers to customers in 2007 when I joined Smiths Aerospace (soon to become GE Aviation Systems) as a commercial manager in their aftermarket services division. I joined Ontic in 2013, where I established a new commercial function and ultimately became the site director in 2016 with general management responsibility for the UK and Singapore business.

Ontic

What have been the highlights?

This industry has given me some great opportunities to work internationally. From my first Paris air show as a junior member of the A400M marketing team to my time in Shanghai representing GE as we negotiated the deal to supply avionics to the Comac C919 programme, I have always enjoyed experiencing business from different cultural perspectives. My time with BBA Aviation, and Ontic in particular, has been incredibly rewarding. The business has invested heavily in developing its executive leadership capabilities, and I have been fortunate enough to attend some really interesting courses at Duke University in North Carolina. The programme centred around the use of experiential learning in a number of challenging scenarios which encouraged better decision making under pressure and exhibiting greater leadership presence. These skills have been put to use recently and we completed the 2016 acquisition of GE Aviation’s legacy avionics business. As well as playing a key role in the deal team, I am now accountable for ensuring the orderly integration of the business, including the transfer of a large number of employees and a significant investment in our facility as we establish new capabilities and a major expansion in our capacity. We’ve recently secured our 13th licence or acquisition in the six years since the establishment of the Ontic UK business.

What does your job entail?

I have general management responsibility for the Ontic business outside the USA. We have a facility near Cheltenham, that employs approximately 250 people, and a small MRO organisation in Singapore. I lead an extremely capable management team, and spend much of my time ensuring that they have everything they need to perform to their highest potential. As well as my daily focus on executing our profit and loss deliverables, I also spend much of my time engaging with our customers to discuss new ways to support their legacy in-service aircraft. Having formed a close partnership with the US Navy, we recently hosted the McDonnell Douglas AV8B UK supplier summit. Ontic supplies the Harrier gas turbine starter unit and has recently helped the end user achieve target readiness levels by dramatically improving parts availability. Beyond my responsibilities at the site, I am also a member of the Ontic senior leadership team. As a group, we are increasingly focused executing our strategic plan and the intelligent deployment of capital.

What challenges do you face?

By its very nature, the Ontic business model is fundamentally challenging. Our organisation acquires or licences non-core, and often legacy, products from our OEM partners. Whilst this allows them to free up resources and liberate stranded capital so they can focus on new programmes and developments, it means Ontic is often trying to solve significant problems for our mutual customers. Products are typically hindered by obsolescence, cold supply chains, aged tooling, poor documentation and outdated manufacturing procedures. Ontic makes this its core business and ultimately extends and increases parts availability to allow customer to keep flying their aircraft long past their original expectations. This means that our business is constantly growing and then changing to accommodate new products and capabilities. As leaders in the organisation, we are all very mindful of the significance of providing absolute clarity to our teams and regular communication. By doing this we’ve managed to consistently maintain industry leading levels of employee engagement across the company. Not easy when we are constantly evolving!

What do you enjoy most about your job?

I love having the opportunity to work with so many great people. Our staff are very highly skilled, dedicated and very flexible. We go out of our way to promote people internally wherever we can and I love doing what I can to help our most talented people develop their careers at Ontic. Our business is typically characterised by low volume and a high level mix of different product services and markets. The sheer variety of challenges means that I can spend my time focusing on everything from supporting our annual supply chain conference to ensuring our ability to meet Boeing’s increasing 737 production rates. Ontic has grown very successfully over the past decade and it’s been a privilege to be a part of this success and then share that with the team in the UK.

What is the strategy for Ontic going forward?

Ontic is continuing to focus on its core business by deploying capital and investing in relieving OEMs of their non-core and legacy product lines. To be successful, we have to continue to demonstrate our expertise in transitioning and integrating challenging businesses then focus on delivering parts and services to our customers. We need to be the best at managing cold start supply chains and being competent and pragmatic when it comes to product sustainment engineering. Attracting and developing talent in these two key areas is essential for our success and maintaining a heavy focus on continuous improvement will allow us to ensure that customers continue to receive the support they need and that our investors see a positive return.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus is ready to dot the Is and cross the Ts on an agreement with local authorities to build a new final assembly line for the A220 in Mobile, Alabama.

The European airframer, which acquired a majority stake in the A220 programme from Bombardier in July, expects to sign the agreement with the Mobile Airport Authority within the week, a senior Airbus official tells FlightGlobal at an event marking the first A220 delivery to Delta Air Lines in Montreal today.

Airbus plans to break ground on the final assembly line at adjacent to Mobile Downtown airport in 2019 after the ""first of the year"", with A220 production on-track to begin in 2020, they say.

Airbus and Bombardier announced plans in 2017 to create a Mobile assembly line for the A220, then known as the CSeries. At the time, Boeing and Bombardier were embroiled in a trade dispute. Boeing alleged damages from the 2016 sale by Bombardier of 75 CS100s to Delta at discounted prices, and was pushing US authorities to implement tariffs on the aircraft.

The Mobile facility, Airbus and Bombardier said, would circumvent such tariffs as the aircraft would be assembled in the USA.

Despite an initial recommendation of a nearly 300% tariff, the US International Trade Commission ruled against Boeing in January, paving the way to the tariff-free delivery to Delta from Montreal Mirabel airport today.

Delta, the A220's North American launch operator and largest customer to date, could begin taking aircraft from the planned Mobile facility as soon as late 2020, says the Atlanta-based carrier's chief executive Ed Bastian at the event.

""We prefer to see production coming out of Mobile as well [as Mirabel],"" he says. ""But for now, for the next two years, we're happy getting them out of Mirabel.""

Delta anticipates four more A220-100 deliveries through the end of this year, and another 23-24 aircraft in 2019, says Bastian. All of those aircraft will be assembled at Mirabel.

The new A220 assembly line will join Airbus' existing A320 family line in Mobile, part of its growing manufacturing presence in the USA. It also has a helicopter assembly line in Mississippi.",Flight Global,0

"For Boeing, the official opening of its new UK parts manufacturing factory probably fell on the wrong date – coming, as it did, less than a week after London was revealed to be in the market for $3.5 billion-worth of new Chinook helicopters.

That meant many of the questions the airframer faced ahead of the inauguration ceremony were about whether it has invested enough back into the UK, given the nation’s healthy appetite for its defence platforms.

Of course, with a substantial fleet of CH-47s already in service, the UK was always likely to head back to Boeing for replacements, with there being few options out there for heavy-lift helicopters. But the potential buy comes on the back of previous deals for AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, C-17 transports, P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, and strong interest in acquiring the E-7 Wedgetail – Boeing products all.

On the face of it, the investment of over £40 million ($51.5 million) in the new plant is small beer, particularly against the billions flowing back across the Atlantic.

But there are other criteria to consider beyond that headline figure, such as the UK’s capability as a manufacturing location and the dollar value of the site’s annual output.

And, as Brexit looms – with a nervous Airbus watching with dismay – perhaps the UK needs all the friends money can buy.",Flight Global,0
"The presidential election in Brazil today is an ""important step"" for the proposed commercial aircraft joint venture between Boeing and Embraer.

The runoff election pits far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro against leftist candidate Fernando Haddad of the ruling Workers' Party, with the former previously speaking in favour of the venture and the latter against it.

""Today, indeed, is an important step,"" says Arjan Meijer, chief commercial officer of Embraer, of the election aboard an Embraer 190-E2 preview flight at the ALTA Leaders Forum in Panama today. While he declines to comment on the outcome, Brazilian government approval of the deal with Boeing is critical to its moving forward.

Bolsonaro was polling ahead of Haddad ahead of the vote today, according to reports.

Boeing would take an 80% stake in Embraer's commercial aircraft and services business, with the Brazilian airframer the minority partner, under the terms of the agreement announced in July. The deal values Embraer's commercial business, which includes the popular E-Jet programme, at $4.75 billion.

The tie-up followed Airbus' purchase of a 50.01% stake in Bombardier's CSeries programme in July, eight months after being announced. The A220, as the aircraft has been rebranded, competes with the larger models in Embraer's E-Jet line up.

Airbus' sales clout helped it win an order from JetBlue Airways for 60 A220-300s to replace its E190s, a type it launched in 2005.

Boeing and Embraer are in the process of ""finalising"" the joint venture agreement, says Meijer, adding that they maintain their target to close the deal in the second half of 2019.

In addition to government support, the tie-up needs shareholder and antitrust approval, he says.",Flight Global,0
"""Progress has been made"" by EasyJet's US partner Wright Electric toward developing an electric passenger airliner capable of flying up to 270nm (500km), the UK budget carrier has declared.

Wright Electric has applied for a patent of a ""novel motor design"" to power an ""EasyJet-sized"" electric airliner, says the airline, without providing detail of the architecture being proposed.

""[The] development suggests that the transition towards an all-electric commercial passenger jet capable of flying passengers across EasyJet's UK and European network is in sight,"" it adds.

The aircraft will be designed by Darold Cummings, an engineer and consultant who has previously worked for Boeing and the US Department of Defense.

Wright Electric is making preparations to perform a first flight of a nine-seat electric aircraft in 2019.

Previously, the Los Angeles-based start-up completed flight tests with a two-seat electric aircraft, built in co-operation with Spain's Axter Aerospace, a specialist in hybrid-powered light aircraft.

Noting that a range of 270nm is targeted for the electric airliner, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren states that the airline's route between London and Amsterdam ""could become the first electric flyway"".

Lundgren believes ""it is important to our customers that we operate sustainably"", and that ""technological advancements in electric flying are truly exciting, and it is moving fast"".

He adds: ""We can now foresee a future that is not exclusively dependent on jet fuel.""

"Tru Simulation and Training has delivered to Ansett Aviation Training the world's first full-flight simulator of a Viking Air CL-415 water bomber.

The South Carolina-based flight training company delivered the Level D simulator to Ansett's training site in Milan, Italy, in September, Tru says. The company expects the device to soon receive EASA certification and be operational by December.

Tru describes the simulator as significantly advancing the safety of CL-415 operations at a time when forest fires – including those in Sweden, Greece and the USA – have increased demand for trained pilots.

""It's going to be a simulator with a tremendous impact on the industry,"" says George Karam, vice-president and general manager of Tru's air transport simulation division. ""Once crews start experiencing the fidelity of that simulator, we are anticipating more demand.""

Tru already supplies some non-motion, ""low-fidelity"" CL-series training products. But, the lack until now of full-flight simulators has meant that much CL training occurs in the cockpits of the amphibious aircraft – a complex machine that often operates in technically challenging environments, Karam says.

CL-series aircraft, previously produced by Canadair and Bombardier, have been involved in 40 accidents since 1970, killing 56 people, and half of all CL-415 crashes have occurred during training, Tru says.

""A lot [of incidents] happened during training, which unfortunately led to injuries and fatalities,"" Karam says. ""You are not just training for flying, but also for the missions. The results of that is that there is significant risk for that training.""

The new simulator replicates the CL-415's characteristics both in flight and on the water as a ""boat"", and can recreate various water conditions, Karam says. ""You are simulating two different crafts in different states, and in between.""

The machine also simulates various types and intensities of forest fires, and related changes in environmental conditions, he adds.

"Airbus has been promoting its A220 to a variety of carriers in Southeast Asia since it took over the former CSeries programme from Bombardier in July.

Aymeric Dupront, Airbus's head of airline marketing for Southeast Asia, says potential customers of the A220 are either new players seeking low operating costs, or regional-jet operators that want to modernise their fleets or operate aircraft larger than 100-seaters.

""In Southeast Asia, there are many regional airlines that operate one or two aircraft with around 100 seats. The A220 has the modernity of the A350, so it offers a new world of low operating costs for those kind of airlines,"" says Dupront.

Low-cost carriers also appear to be another target segment for the European airframer, with Dupront adding that the aircraft's operating economics suit the region well.

""Southeast Asia is a market that is very price-sensitive, and it is a market that is driven by low-cost carriers... Over 50% of the network is operated by low-cost carriers... seeking to reduce their seat-mile cost.""

The A220 comes in two variants: the -100, which can be configured between 100 and 135 seats, and the -300, which can fit between 130 and 160 seats.

Dupront adds that the A220 will have a role to play in the rise of point-to-point traffic in the region. Given that a number of those new routes would initially have thin demand, they are better served with regional jets.",Flight Global,0

"General Electric's aviation division posted significant third quarter gains in revenue and profit amid a continued acceleration in deliveries of CFM International Leap turbofans.

The Boston-based company handed over 303 Leap engines in the third quarter, up from 250 in the second quarter, GE reports on 30 October.

The company is sticking to its projection of delivering 1,100 to 1,200 Leap powerplants for the full-year of 2018.

The GE aviation unit's third quarter profit soared 25% year-over-year to $1.7 billion.

The results reflect a 12% jump in aviation revenue, to $7.5 billion. That amount includes $5.6 billion in revenue from sales and service of commercial aircraft engines, a 17% one-year gain.

The aviation division received orders worth $9.1 billion in the third quarter, up 35%. Those orders included $4.1 billion in equipment orders and $5.1 billion in orders for services, GE says.

""We continue to see real underlying strength in the aviation unit,"" GE chief financial officer Jamie Miller says during the company's earnings call. She notes global passenger air travel has jumped 6.8% this year, meaning more demand for engines.

""Our engines are just flying more,"" she says. ""Which means we bill more hours under services contract, we consume more parts as they go into maintenance.""

Miller says GE's production of Leap engines, which power Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320neo family aircraft, remains about four weeks behind schedule.

But she insists the company remains ""committed"" to its 1,100-1,200 Leap delivery goal for 2018.

CFM International, which GE and French company Safran Aircraft Engines own jointly, has delivered 739 Leap turbofans so far in 2018, meaning it must deliver another 361 of the engines before year-end to meet the goal.

CFM delivery delays have radiated outward, with Boeing executives citing CFM for contributing to troubles ramping 737 production.

Leap engine issues appeared last year when Boeing grounded its 737 Max test fleet to address turbine disk issues. CFM also found problems with coatings on Leap ceramic matrix composite parts, as well as suffered from broader supply chain shortages.",Flight Global,1
"Divers searched on Tuesday for victims of the Lion Air plane crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people and high-tech equipment was deployed to find its data recorders as reports emerged of problems on the jet's previous flight that had terrified passengers.

Search and rescue personnel worked through the night, sending 24 body bags to identification experts while the airline flew dozens of grieving relatives to the country's capital, Jakarta.

The two-month-old Boeing jet crashed into the Java Sea early on Monday, just 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta for an island off Sumatra. Its pilot had requested clearance to return to the airport just 2-3 minutes after takeoff, which aviation experts said indicated a problem, though its cause is still baffling.

The National Search and Rescue Agency said 10 intact bodies as well as body parts have been recovered. Aircraft debris and personal belongings from ID cards to clothing and bags found scattered in seas northeast of Jakarta are being spread out on tarps at a port in north Jakarta.

The disaster has reignited concerns about safety in Indonesia's fast-growing aviation industry, which was recently removed from European Union and US blacklists.",Telegraph,0
"British police have been forced to ground some of their drones after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) warned they were losing power mid-flight and falling from the sky.

A ""handful of drones"" were affected by a glitch that cut their power and made them crash land, the regulator said. The error occurred even when the drone's batteries appeared to have charge remaining.

The drone model, used by UK emergency services, is used in search and rescue operations and for crime prevention and investigation. The outage affected the M200 series of drones produced by Chinese manufacturer DJI.

Police in Norfolk, Devon, Cornwall and the West Midlands are among those deploying DJI drones to find missing persons and conduct investigations.

West Midlands Police alerted the CAA over the issue after one of its drones lost power during an operation and was forced to land on the roof of a commercial building.

A spokesman said: ""The model will not take flight again unless the CAA and industry experts can prove it poses no further risk. Safety is our number one priority and we have been working closely with the supplier and the CAA.""

"Spirit AeroSystems has fully recovered from fuselage production delays that recently rippled from its Wichita manufacturing facility to Boeing's 737 assembly site in Renton, say Spirit's executives.

Having recovered, the company is now working to reduce 737 production costs and taking steps to ensure it can meet Boeing's plan to boost 737 production next year.

""We are fully recovered on our delivery schedule,"" Spirit chief executive Tom Gentile says during the company's third quarter earnings call on 31 October. ""Our focus now is improving efficiencies.""

Spirit's posted a third quarter profit of $169 million, up 15% year-over-year. Revenue increased up 4% to $1.8 billion, while costs inched up 3% to $1.6 billion.

The higher costs partly reflect Spirit's efforts to ramp up 737 fuselage work, which led to increased employee costs and express shipping expenses, says chief financial officer Sanjay Kapoor.

""Now that we are on schedule… we expect continued cost improvement on the 737 programme in the fourth quarter,"" he says.

The fuselage division's third quarter profit slipped 6% year-on-year to $135 million, the propulsion system unit's profit increased 5% to $76 million and the wing systems unit posted a 19% jump in profit, to $59 million.

Spirit shipped 160 737 fuselages to Boeing in the third quarter – nine fewer than last quarter, but still ahead of Boeing's 52-aircraft monthly production target.

Spirit delivered 457 737 fuselages in the first nine months of 2018, it reports.

Boeing increased 737 production from 47 to 52 aircraft earlier this year, but failed to meet that target for much of 2018. The airframer's production slipped to 29 737s in July before recovering to 61 in September.

Boeing's difficulties partly reflected inability by key suppliers – including Spirit and engine maker CFM International – to deliver components on time, Boeing executives have said.

Spirit's executives spent much of the earnings call insisting the company is prepared to meet demand next year, when Boeing plans to boost 737 production again, to 57 aircraft monthly.

Gentile says Spirit has built a ""buffer"" into its production line, hired more suppliers, increased employee training and already hired 90% of employees needed for the surge.

""With this level of preparation, we are very confident in our ability to execute a smooth rate [increase] to 57 aircraft per month,"" he says.

Spirit's troubles should also ease next year as the company moves beyond the complexities of its transition from production of 737NG to 737 Max fuselages, says Gentile.

Production is currently split evenly, but by 2019 737 Max fuselages will account for 90% of production, he says, noting that the Max fuselage is 35% different from the NG's.

Spirit is also prepared to meet demand as Boeing increases 787 production from 12 to 14 aircraft monthly next year, Gentile adds.",Flight Global,0
"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) has thrown a Y220bn ($1.94 billion) financial lifeline to its Mitsubishi Aircraft unit, developer of the troubled MRJ regional jet.

The financial support package will involve a capital injection of Y170 billion ($1.5 billion) into the aircraft manufacturer, and the cancellation of Y50 billion in debt owed to MHI.

As a result, the airframer’s paid-in capital will nearly triple to Y270 billion from Y100 billion, and MHI’s stake will grow from 64% to 86.7%. Other shareholders will see their stake dilute to 13.3%.

“The added capital will bring Mitsubishi Aircraft out of its capital deficit and provide the company with funds to enable continued development of the MRJ,” says MHI.

At 31 March, Mitsubishi Aircraft’s liabilities exceeded its assets by Y110 billion.

An investor presentation by MHI shows that for the six months to 30 September, the MRJ programme recorded no revenue, and made a loss of Y47.2 billion from its operations. That is an improvement on the Y55.4 billion loss for the same period last year.

“With the 170 billion yen to be acquired from MHI, Mitsubishi Aircraft will allocate 85 billion yen to its capital and an equal amount to its capital reserve,” says MHI.

The MRJ90 is expected to enter service with launch customer All Nippon Airways in 2020, six years later than originally planned. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that the type has 213 orders, while its smaller sibling, the MRJ70, has yet to notch up its first order.

"Spirit AeroSystems remains confident it will close a proposed acquisition of European aerospace company Asco despite concerns from European regulators.

""We… continue to work on closing the Asco acquisition,"" Spirit chief executive Tom Gentile says on 31 October. ""We remain confident we will close the deal.""

Gentile's comments come after the European Commission identified unspecified ""issues"" with the deal.

""These issues do not involve any divestiture, nor do we anticipate they will impact the economics of the deal,"" Gentile says.

Spirit in May announced it signed an agreement to buy Asco parent SRIF for $650 million.

Asco produces aircraft components related to landing gear, aircraft structures, fuselages and wings, like slat and flap equipment.

Wichita-based Spirit, which produces 737 fuselages, says Asco would give it more work related to Airbus A320s, A350s and the Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter.

"LATAM Airlines Group chief executive Enrique Cueto has slammed engine manufacturers for the issues that grounded the carrier's Boeing 787 and Airbus A320neo aircraft.

""In this million dollar dance, what the manufacturers are doing is not acceptable,"" Cueto said during a chief executive panel at the ALTA Airline Leaders Forum in Panama City on 30 October.

The lack of certainty on the number of aircraft that would be impacted has made it difficult for the airline to plan, says a frustrated Cueto. LATAM was forced to wet-lease Airbus A330s and a Boeing 747 in the second quarter to operate flights in place of the 787s.

A senior Rolls-Royce executive who had visited LATAM in Santiago told the carrier that it would have ""maximum"" two 787s grounded due to problems with the type's Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. But the airline was eventually forced to ground as many as 14 aircraft, says Cueto.

""If they had told you six or seven months ahead that you might need to ground 14 aircraft, you can plan and prepare,"" says Cueto. ""The lack of anticipation we've had is incredible… we are not having the product that we should.""

He notes that the airline operates the type on long-haul routes across the South Pacific to Australia and New Zealand, making the situation more complex.

A LATAM spokesman tells FlightGlobal that four of the airline's 24 787s remain on the ground currently, awaiting preventive engine maintenance from Rolls-Royce.

The airline has four A320neos in service, and had also previously reported delivery delays with the type, due to well-documented issues with the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engine.

Like LATAM, Avianca also had to ground two 787s for engine repairs, although the airline's entire 13-aircraft 787 fleet is in service currently, albeit with certain operational restrictions.

Avianca chief executive Hernan Rincon says the 787 grounding was a ""PR [public relations] problem"" for the airline, as passengers had complained about the older wet-leased aircraft that had replaced the 787s on flights.

""Some passengers said they felt they were being discriminated against,"" says Rincon.",Flight Global,0
"Viking Air expects to decide in the first quarter of 2019 whether to move forward with development and production of its proposed CL-515, an upgraded version of the CL-215 and CL-415 water bombers.

Sidney, British Columbia-based Viking also envisions the CL-515 as a multi-mission aircraft capable of performing firefighting, surveillance, medevac and other missions, says executive vice-president of sales and marketing Robert Mauracher.

""We expect board approval for go or no go by the end of the first quarter next year,"" Mauracher tells FlightGlobal.

If the project gets the go-ahead, Viking anticipates the first CL-515 will fly in 2024, and envisions production of four to five aircraft annually for 10 years, Mauracher says.

The CL-515 would have twin Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123AF turboprop engines, modern avionics and situational awareness technology. Landing weight may also be increased over the current CL models, and water capacity would rise to 7,000 litres (1,850USgal), up from the current standard of about 6,000 litres on the CL-415, Mauracher says.

Viking, which acquired Bombardier's CL programme in 2016, anticipates the CL-515 will deliver a 12-15% fuel-efficiency improvement over the previous-generation aircraft.

In addition to the firefighting derivative, Viking might offer CL-515s with advanced sensors for use in search and rescue and maritime surveillance roles. Viking is also considering a boom system for spraying insect repellent or oil suppressant, and a large cargo door for medevac work.

""We are moving into the multi-role, multi-mission capability,"" Mauracher says.

A recent spate of forest fires, and the fact that many in-service CLs are nearing retirement, sparked Viking's interest in an upgraded derivative.

""This is the only factory-built aerial firefighter in the world,"" he says. ""We see the market developing quite nicely.""

The CL-515 would be based on the CL-415EAF - or enhanced aerial firefighter - a derivative being developed by Viking affiliate Longview Aviation Asset Management.

Longview is updating 11 CL-215s with PW123AFs, winglets and other improvements to create CL-415EAFs, says Mauracher, who is also Longview's chief operating officer.

Longview expects to deliver the first CL-415EAF in 2020 to launch customer Bridger Aerospace, a firefighting company based in Montana. Shipments of that variant will run until 2024, at which point CL-515 production could commence, he says.",Flight Global,0
"Customisation complexity on the A321neo as well as a shift to new automation are among the industrial internal difficulties facing Airbus as it battles to reach ambitious full-year delivery targets.

Airbus is aiming to deliver 800 aircraft – including 18 A220s – but has encountered further obstacles on its single-aisle lines, on top of the highly-publicised powerplant issues which affected A320neo-family production.

Chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm says the ‘cabin flex’ configuration change introduced on the A321neo, including the longer-range model, “poses some challenges”.

Wilhelm says this version is a “complex aircraft” requiring a higher level of customisation.

Production of the new models alongside the standard variants has created issues, he says, and Airbus has needed to introduce measures to “separate” the two in order to “avoid disturbance” to the assembly line flow.

Airbus has also had to invest in higher levels of automation – including a fourth A320neo final assembly line at Hamburg Finkenwerder – which has “proved to be more demanding and challenging” than the airframer expected, in terms of production ramp-up, adds Wilhelm.

The hurdles have exacerbated the earlier A320neo production problems caused by technical snags particularly affecting the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engine.

Wilhelm admits that the normally-smooth single-aisle production line has been “under fire” as a result of several revisions of planning processes driven by the various issues.

“We’ll overcome and master [them],” he insists. “We can assure you of the full attention of the commercial aircraft team.”

He believes the challenges on both the industrial side and the engine supply side – further modifications of the PW1100G engine are due next year, he says – can be overcome over the course of 2018-19, easing the path towards higher single-aisle production rates.

Airbus is continuing to plan for a hike in monthly single-aisle output to 60 aircraft next year, and is still studying rates beyond this figure.

Wilhelm says the timeframe for such an increase is yet to be determined, but that it would not occur before the next decade. “It would require some investments and a longer lead-time to get ready,” he says.

Airbus delivered 395 A320-family jets over the first nine months of the year, and 503 aircraft in total. Reaching the full-year target of 800 aircraft would involve delivering almost 100 aircraft, on average, for each of the three months in the fourth quarter.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus has rejigged its A330neo delivery schedule after Rolls-Royce admitted it would fall short on Trent 7000 engine deliveries, but the airframer is still maintaining a target of 800 aircraft deliveries.

But this target now includes 18 A220s, whereas Airbus had previously intended to deliver 800 aircraft excluding the A220 contribution.

Airbus concedes that, even with this switch, the delivery target is becoming a “greater stretch”.

The A330neo engine supply issue, it says, adds further pressure to its own “internal industrial challenges” – reportedly centred on A321neo production – as the company continues to deal with the backlog of engineless A320neos.

“We still have a lot to do to meet our commitments,” says chief executive Tom Enders in a third-quarter results disclosure – the first quarter since consolidation of the A220.

Enders says commercial aircraft deliveries and A320neo-family ramp-up remain the “primary operational focus”.

Airbus adds that it its working to resolve “certain commercial challenges” on the baseline A330 and A380 programmes, which it intends to complete by the end of this year.

The airframer is maintaining a full-year adjusted earnings forecast of €5 billion, including a “lower expected reduction” in this figure arising from the A220 inclusion.

Airbus had previously indicated, in its half-year results, that the A220 would reduce full-year adjusted earnings by €200 million, to €5 billion.

It says the net cash impact of A220 integration will be “largely covered” by funding arrangements made during the acquisition of the programme, meaning “limited” cash dilution.

Airbus’ adjusted earnings for its commercial aircraft division at the nine-month stage trebled to €2.34 billion, with revenues increasing by 11% to €30.5 billion.

Its third-quarter performance has benefited, it says, from improvements to ramp-up on the A320neo-family programme and good progress on the A350 programme.",Flight Global,0
"The US Department of Justice has levied new charges against 10 alleged Chinese spies who purportedly sought to steal proprietary corporate information, including information related to commercial aircraft turbofan engines.

An indictment filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California comes three weeks after the DOJ revealed it indicted another Chinese national as part of a similar conspiracy that targeted aerospace companies including GE Aviation.

""Members of the conspiracy targeted, among other things, data and information related to a turbofan engine used in commercial jetliners,"" says the latest indictment. ""At the time of the intrusions, a Chinese state-owned aerospace company was working to develop a comparable engine for use in commercial aircraft manufactured in China and elsewhere.""

The DOJ alleges that the Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security – the provincial arm of China's counter-intelligence unit – managed a network of spies who hacked Western aerospace companies' computers using a variety of methods.

The conspiracy occurred between 2010 and 2015, and ""focused on the theft of technology underlying a turbofan engine used in US and European commercial airliners"", DOJ says.

The government lists 13 unnamed companies as targeted. Most are based in the USA, including in Massachusetts, Arizona, Los Angeles, San Diego, Oregon and Wisconsin. Also targeted were an Australian company, two UK companies and a French aircraft engine maker.

The indictment calls particular attention to the French engine maker, which it describes as developing a turbofan engine in ""partnership with a US company. The French company also has offices in Suzhou, DOJ says.

The US Government provides no other information identifying the French company, but Safran Aircraft Engines fits the DOJ's description.

Safran owns CFM International in partnership with US-based GE, the victim of the corporate theft described in the DOJ's earlier indictment. That indictment was filed in April but became public on 10 October. It outlined a similar scheme to steal engine information from GE.

CFM produces the Leap engine, which powers Boeing 737 Max and Airbus A320neo-family aircraft.

Safran did not immediately response to a request for comment.

DOJ says China's state security agency planted two Chinese nationals in jobs at the French company's Suzhou office in 2013 and 2014. Those spies hacked the French company's computer, says the US government.

The indictment also notes the alleged theft occurred as a Chinese aerospace company was developing a ""comparable engine"".

DOJ does not name the Chinese company, but the previous indictment calls attention to, but does not implicate, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) and Aviation Industries of China (AVIC).

AVIC has been developing a turbofan engine for the COMAC C919, an in-development aircraft that is also offered with CFM's Leap-1C turbofan.

""Members of the conspiracy hacked [companies] … to steal sensitive data from these companies that could be used by Chinese entities to build the same or similar engine without incurring substantial research and development expenses,"" DOJ says.

“The threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless,” says John Brown, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's special agent in charge of the San Diego field office, in a media release.

"Development of the CRAIC CR929 is gathering pace, as its Sino-Russian manufacturers look for more parts suppliers having finalised its external shape.

In July, Russia's United Aircraft (UAC) and China's Comac put out a formal request for an undercarriage supplier. This followed an announcement in May that the joint venture had received bids from seven domestic and foreign engine suppliers. A month earlier, CRAIC had submitted proposals relating to certification procedures for the CR929, with Russian federal regulator Rosaviatsia in charge of certification responsibilities, in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

Also in June, CRAIC finalised the external dimensions and shape of the long-haul aircraft, clearing another major hurdle in the design process. The initial -600 variant's configuration was shown to have a leading-edge sweep similar to the Airbus A350 or the Boeing 787, but with a seemingly narrower outboard section.

UAC lists the -600 variant with a capacity of up to 280 seats. The CR929 also has a shrink variant (the -500) with 250 seats, and a stretch variant (-700) with up to 320.

Richard Evans, senior consultant at Flight Ascend Consultancy, expects the CR929 to have a higher empty weight than the 787 and A350, while having the same level of engine technology – presumably using derivatives of the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000-TEN/7000 and/or General Electric GEnx.

This, he explains, is consistent with the -600's quoted range of 6,480nm (12,000km), which is similar to the 242t variant of the A330-300, which uses lower thrust and higher SFC (thrust-specific fuel consumption) engines. The -500 is expected to have an operational range of up to 7,560nm, the -700 up to 5,400nm.

UAC and Comac have previously indicated that the aircraft is expected to be initially powered by an engine from one of the major Western manufacturers, with an indigenous powerplant to be developed later. Reports suggest that GE Aviation and R-R responded to the engine request for proposals in July 2017. Pratt & Whitney has also proposed to build a new widebody aircraft engine based on its fan drive gear system.

On the indigenous engine front, Moscow awarded a $1.13 billion contract in January to United Engine and Aviadvigatel to develop a demonstrator powerplant named the PD-35-1 by 2023. It is expected to have over 70,000lb (312kN) of thrust and mimics the structural configuration of the 787's GEnx-1B engine. It will feature several state-of-the-art technologies, including wide-chord composite fan blades and a composite fan case, ceramic matrix composites and advanced cooling systems.

""This thrust level has been set above what is perhaps really needed for the initial -600 variant, with a view to the aircraft being heavier than desired, plus an eye on the stretched version's requirements,"" says Evans.

The dual engine option is also found on the Russia-made Irkut MC-21, which is scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2020. Customers can select either the Aviadvigatel PD-14 or P&W PW1400G.

The selection of suppliers for key aircraft systems and equipment is part of CRAIC's ""Gate 3"" milestone that is expected to be cleared by mid-2019, says UAC. The other next steps involve completing windtunnel tests and choosing structural materials.

With the CR929 scheduled for entry into service in the late-2020s, Ray Jaworowski, senior aerospace analyst at Forecast International, adds that it ""would not be a surprise"" if there were delays, as with any new aircraft programme.

Nonetheless, UAC will be hoping that the CR929 will be more successful than its last widebody, the Ilyushin Il-96. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that only 25 Il-96s have entered commercial service with six airlines, with the last aircraft delivered in 2016. Just 15 remain in service today.

INVOLVEMENT OF WESTERN SUPPLIERS

Analysts say the development of the CR929 means more than just national pride for China and Russia.

Jaworowski says manufacturing the aircraft would give Comac ""another stepping stone to future inroads into the global commercial aerospace market"". The Chinese manufacturer will hence find it easier to form partnerships with Western suppliers and establish a sales, marketing, and product support infrastructure.

On the other hand, Western manufacturers involved in the CR929 programme could have another avenue into a ""market of considerable potential,"" he adds.

But global trade tensions, namely those between the USA and China, could represent ""a wild card in the situation"", says Jaworowski. He elaborates that an escalating trade war, with retaliatory tariffs between the respective countries, could make Western systems more expensive for CRAIC to install on the CR929. There could also be a disruption to CRAIC's supply chain.

Nonetheless, he is confident that the CR929 could see substantial sales.

""Rapid economic and air traffic growth in China promise a burgeoning market for new airliners. Russian airlines will also engage in substantial fleet modernisation in the years ahead. Barring trade complications, much of this demand will be met by aircraft from Airbus and Boeing, but the market will be sizable enough to find room for the CR929.""

Rob Morris, global head of Flight Ascend Consultancy, notes that aircraft programmes are ""long-term enterprises"", and that ""today's increasing trade tensions could hopefully be a relatively short-term phenomenon"".

He argues: ""It would be high-risk for Comac and UAC to view the present tensions as drivers to their selection process, because once they have selected a key supplier it will be challenging to change at any point in the programme.""

That said, he expects more involvement to come from Western OEMs because there are relatively few new commercial aircraft programmes in development, ""provided that they believe the market proposition is acceptable and a business case can be made to supply profitably"".

THE NEED FOR ROBUST CUSTOMER SUPPORT

Potential trade wars are far from the only challenges CRAIC faces, though.

At the 2018 Farnborough air show, UAC subsidiary Sukhoi Civil Aircraft (SCAC) told FlightGlobal it was looking to invest heavily in European customer-support facilities as it sought to boost sales of Superjet 100s to airlines outside Russia.

""It is a lesson we have learnt, to make sure that airlines are fully satisfied with our aircraft. This includes training facilities, improved spare-part supplies and MRO facilities,"" said SCAC president Alexander Rubtsov.

He added that such facilities will be part of a larger network that would also support fellow Russian-built commercial aircraft like the MC-21 and CR929 when these enter service.

Underlining the suboptimal aftersales support from Russian suppliers, Mexico's InterJet seems to have had a less-than-optimum experience with the Superjet. In September, the carrier said it would phase out an unannounced number of the airliners and take 20 more A320neos in a fleet restructuring that formed part of a new three-year strategic plan.

FlightGlobal had previously reported that the cuts to InterJet's Superjet fleet followed several operational challenges the airline had encountered since beginning operations with the type in 2013. Defects to the aircraft's stabiliser nodes forced InterJet to ground half of the fleet in early 2017, and aircraft have been cannibalised for parts.

Meanwhile, a source close to developments says InterJet's support experience with the SSJ100 ""amply illustrates"" the challenge faced by any new aspiring OEM.

""Design and initial delivery of a new commercial aircraft is challenging enough, but the key to winning and retaining airline customers is delivery of a holistic support service which ensures each aircraft is delivered on time and to performance, and then [made] available with dispatch reliability that matches or betters the established OEM products.""

The source adds that InterJet's cannibalisation of aircraft to maintain the operations of others ""indicates a failure in [Sukhoi's] spares support"", causing other potential export customers to seek guarantees from Superjet and other Russian OEMs before even considering an acquisition of aircraft.

Morris says that UAC and Comac can learn lessons from Sukhoi in creating a global support network that covers spares, maintenance and training, should they hope to penetrate international markets.

Evans also echoes similar sentiments and adds: ""It is even more critical for the CR929 as a long-haul aircraft.""

He notes: ""Aircraft-on-ground issues thousands of miles from home are extremely costly and disruptive if not resolved quickly. I would expect any Chinese-operated fleets of CR929s to be flown domestically at first, before airlines have the confidence to deploy them on key European or North American routes.""

DEMAND PROFILE

According to FlightGlobal's 2018 Flight Fleet Forecast, CRAIC stands to break the widebody duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in a decade with the launch of the CR929. It is forecast that deliveries of the CR929 and other in-development twin-aisles will have a potential combined value of $110 billion.

Most demand, inevitably, will come from Russia and China, if the ARJ21, C919, SSJ100, and MC-21 are any guide. Of 305 C919 orders, 255 are from Chinese airlines and lessors, as are 206 of the 223 ARJ21s on order. UAC's entire backlog of 175 MC-21s are from Russian companies, with 10 out of 26 SSJ100 orders from Russia.

In terms of domestic deliveries among the four aircraft types, Sukhoi leads the way with 100 in-service Superjets in Russia, while there are nine ARJ21s in service in China, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.

Flight Fleet Forecast sees the bulk of demand for the CR929 coming from China (61%), with Russia/CIS taking 11% of deliveries. ""Small quantities"" of deliveries are expected for Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

Flight Fleets Analyzer also indicates that there are around 225 A330s in service with Chinese airlines, along with 67 787s and A350s. Analysts expect the CR929's closest competitors to be the A330 and 787, based on seat count and range.

Furthermore, Morris says that instead of airlines placing orders for the CR929, early deliveries are most likely to come from Chinese operating lessors. These buyers will ""be heavily involved"" given their prominence in the orderbooks for the ARJ21 and C919. Still, the CR929's unproven status could pose a worry for them.

""Lessors and financiers will be uncertain about the CR929's liquidity and residual value outlook, and will be nervous about financing it until [it is] proven.""

At the forthcoming Airshow China in Zhuhai, the aerospace world will be looking to learn more about this ambitious Sino-Russian programme.

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fast-growing budget carrier Vietjet Aviation VJC.HM is set to finalize a $6.5 billion jet order with Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) during a visit to Hanoi by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Friday, people familiar with the matter said.

The order for 50 A321neo jets is part of an aggressive investment in the Vietnamese airline’s fleet that has provided lucrative business for both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing.

It is also a boost for Airbus as it seeks to turn a raft of provisional orders put together at July’s Farnborough Airshow into hard revenues, narrowing a gap against Boeing this year.

The deal is the biggest economic component of an official visit to France’s former colony by Philippe from Nov. 2-4, during which he will oversee deals with French firms and hold talks with Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc, they said.

Airbus and Vietjet both declined to comment.

Vietnam and France also signed an agreement in September to expand defense collaboration, although details are scant.

VietJet CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao told Reuters this week that Vietjet plans to maintain an average fleet age of just three years to keep fuel and maintenance costs low.

It placed provisional orders for the A321neo jets and 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets in Farnborough and has been negotiating to firm them up, with deliveries expected between 2020 and 2025.

The formal signing, to take place on Friday, will help to dispel doubts over the substance of deals announced in Farnborough, which was marked by a rash of vague or incomplete order announcements.

Finalizing such deals can involve tough negotiations as airlines try to squeeze out last-minute concessions.

However, finance industry sources have expressed concerns about a glut of orders in Southeast Asia from airlines like Vietjet, Malaysia’s AirAsia (AIRA.KL) and Lion Air of Indonesia and question whether all of the several hundreds of planes on order from the Asian low-cost carriers will actually be delivered.

Vietjet told the Airline Economics conference in Hong Kong this week that low-cost airlines have a relatively low market position in Vietnam, and that those most successful in driving down unit costs would ride out any downturn in the market.

Vietnam’s expansion has also been peppered with trade sensitivities as Vietjet - which says it enjoys government support - juggled Airbus and Boeing procurements: a strategy also designed to win bigger discounts.

Two years ago, Boeing upstaged Airbus by clinching an order for 100 737s during a visit by then-U.S. President Barack Obama.

Until then, VietJet had only bought from Airbus, including an order for 92 jets in 2013.

""Good luck, old cock,"" he wrote. ""Sorry to leave it in such a mess.""

Both French and German probably have a turn of phrase equivalent to this peculiarly British bit of understatement, and Airbus chief Tom Enders might be forgiven if he passed on similar sentiments to Guillaume Faury in either language.

Airbus is somewhat under siege and, in a twist on the regular narrative, much of the pressure is not coming from its traditional US nemesis but from its own partners and internal operations.

The brightest part of the airframer's latest outlook concerned the A350 programme, which has continued to demonstrate remarkably smooth progress, seemingly in defiance of the regular cautions expressed over the challenges involved in ramping up production.

Airbus's recent frustrations have instead been rooted in just about every programme except the A350, putting unwanted pressure on the airframer at a time when its senior management structure – stable for several years – is being overhauled and candidates are being scrutinised as much for their virtues as their skills.

While the A380 continues to languish in the aerospace equivalent of purgatory, the belated transition from the A330 to the re-engined A330neo has been aggravated by a dearth of Rolls-Royce powerplants.

The engine snags and shortages that saddled the A320neo programme are well documented, but the airframer has admitted to vexatious internal single-aisle production issues, notably on its A321neo – a hugely popular model and one which, like the A330neo, is crucial to its middle-market strategy.

Prior to the introduction of the A320neo, Airbus was typically delivering around 40% of its annual output during the fourth quarter. But over the subsequent three years, the stress on the final quarter has sharply increased, with the ratio rising to 49% in 2016 and 58% last year.

Airbus's original production target had left it facing the unenviable burden of delivering 62% of this year's total in the final three months. The newly consolidated A220 has been drafted into a face-saving role that maintains the delivery target of 800 aircraft.

All of this is set against a relatively weak Airbus sales performance – Boeing has taken two-and-a-half times more net orders – and the pressure of a planned single-aisle rate hike. Oh, and Brexit. Welcome to the hot seat, Guillaume. Bonne chance.",Flight Global,0

"Russia’s United Aircraft plans to enhance its customer service capabilities for the Superjet 100, and make customer service a priority for the Irkut MC-21 and CRAIC CR929 programmes.

In an interview with FlightGlobal prior to Air Show China in Zhuhai, UAC chief Yuri Slyusar said that the company was working with both its foreign and Russian customers to improve the Superjet's after-sales programme.

“We intend to invest substantively in after-sales services, both in the central spares stock and in enhancement of the existing stocks capacity…as well as the capacity required for aircraft maintenance,” he says.

“Looking ahead, we plan to come up with a single unified after-sales system for UAC commercial aircraft.”

The company will apply lessons from the Superjet programme to both the MC-21 and CR929. UAC and Comac have formed a joint venture, CRAIC, to develop the new long-haul CR929 twinjet, which is expected to enter service in the late 2020s.

Given that the primary market for the CR929 is the Asia-Pacific region, service facilities and spares warehouses will be developed in both Russia and China. Slyusar says that support is key priority for the developmental type, and a focus area in discussions with suppliers. To be selected as a supplier, a company must have sufficient number of service facilities, warehouses, and technicians globally.

Customer service issues and spares shortages have been a major stumbling block with the Superjets operated by Mexican carrier Interjet. In its most recent financial quarter, the airline received Ps733 million ($39.6 million) in compensation for maintenance costs related to its Superjet fleet, after it was forced to ground at least four of the type during the past year or so.

In a bid to keep Interjet as a customer, Sukhoi Civil Aircraft, the type's manufacturer, is offering cabin densification and fuel-saving 'sabrelet' winglets.

“Our partners are improving the business model, and we are intensively involved in this process by working out proposals and actions concerning fleet adaptation,” says Slyusar. “This means that we are looking for possibilities to enhance the operational capacity at high altitudes, and improving take-off and landing performance, as well as the layout arrangements.”

Sukhoi is also offering other customers upgrades in the form of saberlets and improved landing-gear doors, he adds.

Slyusar touches on the request for information related to the CR929 issued in May. He lists three of the respondents: Rolls-Royce, General Electric, as well as a joint response from Russia’s United Engine and the Aero Engine Corporation of China.

"Airbus and Embraer both see an opportunity to sell their small narrowbody jets to carriers keen to tap the emerging market in western China.

Speaking during a media briefing at Airshow China, Airbus’s head of single-aisle marketing, Amaya Rodrigues Gonzales, says that the government’s plan to open up the high altitude areas of the country’s west for further development will rely on aviation, as trains and roads are not feasible in those regions.

Furthermore, the A220’s hot and high performance, smaller capacity than other narrowbodies and long-range are expected to be a good match for some of the operating and commercial challenges in the region.

“In this case, the size of the aircraft, the range of the aircraft and the capabilities of the aircraft is just perfect,” she says. “They need very good performance at hot and high airports; it’s going to make this aircraft the aircraft of choice, and the aircraft to develop this region.”

Airbus is displaying an Air Baltic A220-300 at the air show, the first leg of an Asian sales tour that will also take it to Chengdu, Koh Samui and Istanbul before returning to the carrier's Riga base.

The A220 has yet to garner any firm orders from China, although Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that there are letters of intent to order 30 A220-100s and 20 A220-300s from Loong Air and CDB Aviation Lease Finance.

However, Airbus is not alone in targeting that market, with Embraer also highlighting the capabilities of the E190-E2 to help airlines access the western China market.

It has already completed demonstration flights into and out of Lhasa, and says that the E190-E2 can fly nonstop from Lhasa to Chengdu with a full load of passengers.

“The E2 will be able to connect tier II and III destinations here in China. It can bypass hubs and most importantly it can offer smaller airplanes in the market, complementing narrowbodies at comparable seat costs,” said Embraer’s head of commercial, Arjan Meijer.

The Brazilian airframer is displaying its ‘profit hunter’ E190-E2 featuring its shark livery on the static line at Zhuhai. After the show finishes, it will embark on a two week sales tour across the country.

“We will show the advanced technology, we will explain everything about the exceptional hot and high performance for the many high, elevated airports here in China,” he adds.

Embraer is also targeting other opportunities in China with its wider portfolio of E-Jets. During a media briefing, vice-president of sales and marketing for Embraer China, Gao Qing, noted that the E175-E1 was the “best choice for startup airlines.”

At the larger end, the airframer claims that its E195-E2 is ideally suited to low-cost carriers.

Overall, Embraer predicts that over the next 20 years there will be demand for 1,390 jets with up to 150 seats in China. It cites plans to open 140 new airports across the country by 2035, and a growing need for airlines to bypass congested hubs as major drivers of that demand.",Flight Global,0
"Continuing consolidation of the commercial aircraft industry is firmly on show in this year’s World Airliner Directory, with Bombardier having exited our first instalment, which covers mainliner types with a minimum seating capacity for greater than 100 passengers.

What was once the Canadian airframer’s flagship CSeries has been subsumed under the Airbus banner, now opening our listing as the A220. While some were doubtful of the European giant’s motives in assuming control of the Bombardier product, early fresh commitments under its leadership and a first delivery to a US carrier – Delta Air Lines – mean that the single-aisle’s prospects are on the up.

Boeing’s 737 Max programme has also starred during 2018, with deliveries steadily accelerating from its Renton assembly line, where combined output for the re-engined type and outgoing NG model now stands at a rate of 52 per month. The rush of Boeing narrowbodies has, however, placed increased pressure on the company’s supply chain, including the provision of CFM International Leap-1B engines.

However, such disruption has been more harshly felt by its European rival, Airbus. With monthly output approaching 60 A320- family aircraft from its four assembly lines in France, Germany, the USA and China, the company has suffered problems in both the performance and supply of Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines.

GOING THE DISTANCE

Highlights so far this year have included first deliveries of the 787-10 and an ultra-longrange version of the A350-900 – both to Singapore Airlines – and the Dreamliner’s nonstop debut between Perth and London Heathrow for Qantas.

Going up in scale, Airbus received a topup, 20-unit order for the A380 from its biggest proponent, Emirates, and has seen a first secondhand example, previously leased by SIA, enter use with Portuguese wet-lease operator Hi Fly. And while Boeing’s 747-8I appears to have reached the end in terms of airliner orders, its freighter variant, the -8F, has secured crucial backing from UPS Airlines, with a deal for 14 safeguarding production through the end of the decade.

Meanwhile, new versions of top-selling models are advancing, with the A330neo ready to enter service in its -900 guise and the 777-9 having entered static testing ahead of a flight debut during 2019.

Scott Kirby, president of United, told analysts in October that he was ""confident"" the carrier would achieve its flat-to-better CASM excluding fuel target in 2019 with ""more to share"" on that this coming January.

The carrier saw CASM excluding fuel, special items, profit sharing and third-party expenses fall 0.4% in the third quarter. Executives expect the metric to be ""better than flat"" for all of 2018.

United has had a rocky relationship with its flight attendants since its merger with Continental Airlines in 2010. It took six years to reach a joint agreement to combine the separate groups under one contract, and another two years to integrate them, which occurred on 1 October.

"Airbus is poised to hand over the first of A330-900 to launch operator TAP Air Portugal, as flight-testing gets underway of the smaller -800 variant.

Speaking at the first flight of the smaller -800 today in Toulouse, A330 marketing chief Crawford Hamilton said the delivery of the first A330neo is imminent. The aircraft is parked at the delivery centre and will be handed over “in the coming days”, he says.

Airbus secured type certification for the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000-powered A330-900 in late September. The first aircraft was originally due for delivery to TAP in early 2018, but the flight-test programme was delayed, primarily due to hold-ups with the Trent 7000 engines.",Flight Global,0
"Ameco Beijing expects to grow its engine overhaul business over the next year thanks to strong demand for International Aero Engines IAE V2500 and Rolls-Royce RB211 shop visits.

Speaking to FlightGlobal at Airshow china, the company's chief operating officer, Andreas Meisel, says that by the end of 2019, its annual throughput of V2500s will rise from 10 to 24, and for RB211s it will increase from 50 to 75 will have an annual throughput of 75 units, up from 50.

In both cases, domestic demand is driving the increase in engine throughput. Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that there are 570 V2500-powered Airbus A320-family aircraft in service in China, and 45 RB211-powered Boeing 757-200s.

Ameco has been pushing hard to grow its V2500 business after having secured authorisation from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, US Federal Aviation Administration, and the European Aviation Safety Agency in 2015.

"The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered airlines to replace components in the compressors and turbines of Pratt & Whitney PW1100Gs turbofans, which power Airbus A320neo-family aircraft.

The orders address corrosion concerns and issues with the engines' ""knife edge seal"" – the same seal that caused several inflight shutdowns earlier this year.

Those shutdowns prompted a grounding of PW1100G-powered A320neos.

""This [directive] was prompted by reports of in-flight engine shutdowns and aborted takeoffs as the result of certain parts affecting the durability of the rear high-pressure compressor… rotor hub knife edge seal,"" says one directive.

That order requires airlines to address the issue by replacing ""diffuser case air seal"" assemblies and vane assemblies in the second stages of high-pressure turbines in affected engines.

The FAA calls the knife-edge seal fix an ""interim action"" while P&W develops a solution. The problem arose because knife edge seals were allowing slightly too much air to pass through the engine.

P&W tells FlightGlobal it developed a fix ""based on a design with which the company has significant experience"".

""The situation was investigated by Pratt & Whitney and the company worked with Airbus, regulators and our customers to release a revised configuration to correct [the] issue in mid-February,"" P&W says. ""We restarted engine deliveries back to Airbus by end of February. As of May 2018 we are caught up on our engine deliveries to Airbus.""

P&W says 43 in-service engines were affected. Airlines returned all of those to P&W, which provided unaffected spares in return, it says.

The other directive orders airlines to replace the ""front hub"" of PW1100G high-pressure compressors – a measure that comes in response to a corrosion report.

""The [high-pressure compressor] front hub exhibited deposits that could not be removed using standard procedures and worsened over time,"" says the directive. ""This condition, if not addressed, could result in uncontained [high-pressure compressor] front hub release, damage to the engine and damage to the airplane.""

Carriers must replace the parts by mid-April, or within 6,180 cycles since the engine was new or five years since shipped, the FAA says.

MTU says that the facility is being expanded from handling around 300 aircraft a engines year today to some 450 from 2021.

This is the second expansion since the site opened in 2001, with an initial capacity to handle 200 engines a year, the engine sub-assembly manufacturer and maintenance provider notes.

The site specialises in support for CFM International CFM56s and International Aero Engines V2500s, and has completed a total of 2,500 shop visits.

"Airbus could not disguise its delight in proving doubters wrong today with the first flight of the A330-800, saying it is “ready to bat the ball right down Boeing’s throat”.

Airbus has concluded flight-testing of the larger -900 variant and is poised to begin deliveries to TAP Air Portugal. But the -800 has had a cloud hanging over it since March when its only customer, Hawaiian Airlines, cancelled its order and switched to the Boeing 787. The -800 test aircraft was already structurally complete at that point and its first flight today (below) follows the commitment of a new launch customer, Kuwait Airways, last month.

“There were people in the industry who said the A330-800 wouldn’t be built, and then they said it would never fly. So today’s event proves that’s nonsense,” said Airbus’s A330 marketing chief Crawford Hamilton at the first flight event today in Toulouse.

The experience losing the Hawaiian order at the hands of Boeing was “fairly brutal”, says Hamilton, which followed a period of intense commercial pressure from its US rival.

“Boeing has been at us with a sledge-hammer for the last 2-3 years, undoubtedly. But there’s no point in being a victim,” he says. “We’re ready to bat the ball right down Boeing’s throat and come out fighting against the 787. That’s what the A330neo’s all about.”

Hamilton says the motivation behind Airbus launching the A330neo family in 2014 was to ensure it could maintain market share against the Boeing 787.

“Up until 2014, we were maintaining about 50% market share versus 787. And we started to see to signs that that was starting to slip. So it was time to do something new. And the logical thing to do was the Neo.”

He says that as a derivative design, the development of the A330neo was relatively low-cost allowing Airbus some commercial “wiggle room” when competing against the all-new 787.

“The public figure [for industrial investment in the A330neo] was $2 billion. We’ve got an aircraft that’s better than the 787 which cost perhaps $50 billion [to develop]. So that means we’ve got a real value product that we can offer.”

Airbus is targeting three market sectors as it looks to add to its existing -800 customers Kuwait Airways, which has eight orders, and Air Uganda which has a memorandum of understanding for two aircraft.

“One of our targets is to replace the massive installed base of A330-200s. Some of the oldest ones will start to go in next few years,” says Hamilton.

“The second part is replacing 767s. We’ve already done that [with -200]. We’re now going to do that with an aircraft that’s even more efficient.”

“Lastly there are new markets like long haul low cost and nations that need a new entry-level aircraft.”

Airbus holds firm orders for 232 A330neos, of which 224 are for the A330-900 and eight are for the -800. AirAsia X is the largest customer, with firm orders for 66 -900s.

The A330-800’s 350h flight-test programme that began today is due to conclude with type certification in mid-2019. Kuwait Airways is currently slated to be the first operator, with deliveries expected to begin in the first half of 2020.",Flight Global,0
"As Airbus prepares to begin deliveries of the A330neo, engine supplier Rolls-Royce is working through industrial ramp-up issues that have slowed shipments of Trent 7000s to the Toulouse assembly line.

Airbus expects to deliver the first A330-900 to launch operator TAP Air Portugal in the coming days, but recently confirmed that deliveries of the aircraft will be slower than expected due to a hold-up at R-R. The UK engine maker acknowledged last month that it expects to deliver fewer Trent 7000 engines in the fourth quarter than originally planned.

Speaking at the A330-800 first flight event today in Toulouse, Rolls-Royce marketing vice-president for Airbus products, Peter Johnston, stated that the production issues being suffered on the Trent 7000 are industrial rather than technical.

“The engine deliveries are ramping up now. They’ve been slower than we wanted, really it’s been a question of the supply chain and getting our industrial ramp-up moving,” he says. Johnston adds that the delays are “not because of the technical issues associated with the Trent 1000 engines”.

Safran Landing Systems chief executive Jean-Paul Alary says the study will “guarantee the complete success of a programme that promises major improvements for both airports and airlines”.

The manufacturer previously developed with Honeywell a main landing gear-mounted electric taxi system, a prototype version of which was demonstrated on an Airbus A320 at the 2013 Paris air show.

"ATR expects China will require 1,100 turboprops in the 30-70 seat category by 2037, the vast majority of which will be used to open up new routes.

The European airframer released its first ever China market forecast at Airshow China, showing that it expects demand for 800 aircraft in the 30-seat category, 70 in the 50 seat category and 230 in the 70 seat category.

Bernard Pabon, ATR’s head of market strategy, explains that the drivers of that will include government initiatves aimed at spurring general and regional aviation growth, the realative efficiency of tubroprops over jets at shorter distances, and demand from travelers to open up new air routes.

“Compared to other regions in the world, we can see China is at a very young maturity stage in its regional network, but yet it is promised to have very tremendous growth ahead,” he says.

Pabon notes that regional aircraft - including regional jets - represent barely 2% of the Chinese commercial aircraft fleet, which is dominated by Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that there are only 38 passenger turboprops in service in the country. That number is comprised of 35 Avic Xian MA-60s, two MA-600s and one Viking Air DHC-8-400 Twin Otters.

A number of narrowbodies in China, Pabon adds, operate on short routes that require subsidies to breakeven. However, using smaller, more efficient turboprops that are better suited to shorter routes could be more profitable, thus dispensing with the need for subsidies.

ATR has had a mixed history in China. China Xinjiang Airlines operated ATR 72s between 1997 and 2010, but the type has been absent from the country since then.

"The Airbus A330-800 test and certification programme began on 6 November and will involve a single aircraft and up to 350h of flight-trials.

Type approval is expected in the third quarter of 2019.

Testing of the first A330-800 (MSN 1888) will piggy-back the much more extensive programme undertaken to approve the larger -900 variant. This comprised two instrumented aircraft and the first customer unit equipped with a furnished cabin flying 1,400h over 400 flights. European certification of the -900 was received on 26 September and deliveries to TAP Air Portugal are about to start.

Airbus says there is 99% commonality between two variants of the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000-powered A330neo family. The -800 is derived from the A330-200, with its key differences over the -900 being a 5m (16.3ft) shorter fuselage and taller fin.

“The shorter fuselage means that the engines are closer to both the front and the back of the aircraft,” Airbus’s head of development flight tests, Jean-Philippe Cottet. “From the front it will have a difference on the anemometry and we’ll have to check that. And from the back it will have an effect on the aircraft’s behaviour.

“We will also have to check the difference in the structural response of the aircraft during the flutter testing,” he adds.

The -800 test aircraft’s cabin is fitted with a medium level of flight-test equipment with a single engineer station seating two flight-test engineers. During its 4h 4min first flight the A330 reached an altitude of at least 30,000ft. Both the take-off and landing were operated with the fly-by-wire system in direct law, as is normal for Airbus first flights.

During the first sortie general handling qualities were explored in all three axes, and flutter pulse checks were completed along with a test of the cabin pressurisation system.

“Testing of the -800 prototype will mainly be dedicated to flight physics, handling qualities and performance,” says Cottet. “The target is to fly 300-350h for the -800 campaign.”

After an initial batch of 5-10 validation flights, the initial development phase will open the -800’s flight envelope with identification and performance flights involving stalls and flutter testing. The next phase will involve development testing to tune the flight-control laws and explore the handling qualities. There will also be certification tests undertaken including crosswind, autopilot and systems trials, along with minimum speed checks.

"Though the CRJ programme remains under Bombardier's wing, company executives made clear on 8 November that Bombardier's focus has shifted away from commercial aviation.

""Bombardier is well positioned with our rail, business aircraft and aero-structures business,"" says chief executive Alain Bellemare during Bombardier's third quarter earnings call. ""In the future, this will be where we will deploy our capital to [ensure] strong return on investment.""

His comments came as Bombardier announced it intends to shed 5,000 jobs and sell both the Dash 8 programme and the business aircraft training unit.

The company is ""sharpening its focus on our biggest growth opportunities"", Bellemare says.

Longview Aviation Capital, an affiliate of British Columbia-based Viking Air, has agreed to purchase the Dash 8 programme, including the Q400, for $300 million. Viking Air in 2016 purchased Bombardier's CL line of water bombers.

""We believe that there's a better owner than us to keep this programme going,"" says Bellemare of the Q400.

The announcement follows news earlier this year that Bombardier sold the Toronto Downsview site where it assembles the Q400. Bombardier has enjoyed some recent Q400 sales success, but outstanding orders still stand at only 62, according to FlightGlobal's Fleets Analyzer database.

Longview calls the Dash 8 a ""perfect complement"" to its portfolio, saying it will ""continue to independently operate"" the Q400 programme at Downsview until at least 2021.

Bombardier also reached a deal to sell its business aircraft training business to Quebec-based pilot training company CAE for $800 million.

Both agreements require regulatory approval and will likely close in the second half of 2019, Bombardier says.

Bellemare insists Bombardier remains committed to CRJs. But, he concedes the programme has been losing money and says Bombardier is keeping options open.

""We will also continue to actively participate in the regional aircraft market,"" he says. ""In terms of exploring strategic options – it something that is always on the table.""

""We are losing money on the CRJs. We need to see more movements [from] the suppliers in terms of reducing cost,"" he adds. ""Our focus is on reducing cost and increasing volumes.""

Bombardier holds only 54 outstanding orders for CRJs, according to FlightGlobal's Fleets Analyzer database.

All 108 on board survived. But a September 2014 report by Indonesia’s air crash investigators highlighted errors and poor training, saying the 24-year-old co-pilot had failed to adhere to the “basic principles of jet aircraft flying.”

Lion Air, struggling to get off a European Union blacklist because of “unaddressed safety concerns,” asked Airbus, which supplies part of its fleet, to help improve training.

The EU removed the privately owned budget airline from the list in 2016 after it determined Lion Air met international safety standards. None of Indonesia’s roughly 100 airlines - most of them tiny - database lists 101, but some are subsidiaries remain on the EU blacklist, with the last few coming off in June. All were banned in 2007; the national carrier, Garuda Indonesia, was the first to be removed in 2009.

The crash of a Lion Air jet on Oct. 29 into the sea off Jakarta has put a spotlight back on the airline’s safety record, although the cause remains undetermined. None of the aircraft’s 189 passengers and crew survived.

Lion Air’s latest crisis illustrates the challenge relatively new carriers face as they try to keep pace with unstoppable demand for air travel in developing nations while striving for standards that mature markets took decades to reach.

Retired air force chief of staff Chappy Hakim, an adviser to the transport ministry, told Reuters he avoided flying with Lion Air or other Indonesian airlines, with the exception of Garuda, which has not had a fatal crash since 2007.

“I know Garuda,” he said of the national carrier. “The other airlines, I don’t believe they do the maintenance and training properly.” He declined to elaborate further.

Lion Air Managing Director Daniel Putut disputed any laxity in the airline’s safety culture, stressing that it conducted maintenance in accordance with manufacturer guidelines.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the Indonesian aviation authority, did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Lion Air’s safety record.

Putut, a former pilot, also told Reuters during a visit to the airline’s training centre near the Jakarta airport that it complied with all regulatory requirements.

He said Lion Air had worked hard to install an attitude of “zero tolerance” for accidents after the Bali crash, making last week’s disaster a painful eye-opener. Thousands of Lion Air flights have taken off and landed without serious incident since then.

“We are also looking into what went wrong - new aircraft, experienced crews, and we have applied the zero-tolerance culture, yet another accident happened,” Putut said. “But we still don’t know the cause, so we will wait for the investigation from NTSC (National Transportation Safety Committee).”

SAFETY CULTURE

Frank Caron, head of a risk consulting firm who served as Lion Air’s safety manager from 2009 to 2011 after insurance companies requested a foreign expert, said that at the time he was troubled by what he regarded as the airline’s attitude that accidents were inevitable.

“Safety is much more than running concepts and procedures,” he said. “Safety is a spirit, a state of mind, a way of thinking, an attitude in the daily aspects of an operational life. And that is precisely what Lion never got. They would say, ‘The airline has 250 flights a day, it is not abnormal that you have accidents.’”

For example, after the 2013 Bali crash, Lion Air co-founder Rusdi Kirana told local media who asked about the airline’s safety record: “If we are seen to have many accidents, it’s because of our frequency of flights.”

Caron claimed he left Lion Air after some of his safety recommendations were not implemented. Lion Air’s chief executive declined to comment on Caron’s account of his departure or his other assertions.

Indonesian accident investigators made four recommendations after the Bali crash, including that Lion Air should “ensure that all pilots must be competent in hand flying” and teach proper cockpit coordination.

They also urged the aviation authority to ensure all airlines under its control did the same.

Putut said Lion Air embraced those recommendations.

Between the Bali crash and the one last week, Lion Air had three non-fatal accidents, including one in April in which a 737 skidded off a runway, according to Flight Safety Foundation’s Aviation Safety Network database.

Since it began operating 18 years ago, Lion Air has seen a total of eight planes damaged beyond repair in accidents, two of which killed a combined 214 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.

During the same period, five jets from its chief rival, the national carrier Garuda Indonesia (GIAA.JK), were damaged beyond repair, and two accidents killed a combined 22 people, according to the database. Garuda declined to comment about its safety record.

Since the 2013 Bali crash, Lion Air has sought to improve safety by gaining European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification for its pilot training and maintenance facilities.

EASA certifies its training centre to instruct other airlines’ pilots on A320 simulators and is seeking the same approvals for 737 jets and ATR72 turboprops, said Audy L Punuh, Lion Air’s Angkasa Pilot Training Organisation Director.

RAPID GROWTH

Lion Air has expanded quickly since it started flying in 2000, overtaking national carrier Garuda by capturing more than half of the domestic market and establishing offshoots in Thailand and Malaysia.

It has ridden a wave of aviation growth in Indonesia, where air travel has become critical for the economy.

Domestic air traffic more than tripled in Indonesia over the past decade as prosperity and low fares made flying affordable for more people.

With 129 million passengers in 2017, the Southeast Asian country was already the world’s 10th-largest aviation market and is projected to continue growing.

That growth has been accompanied by an air-accident rate that was twice the global average in 2017 and consistently higher than Indonesia’s neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, according to the United Nations’ aviation agency.

Indonesian pilots are allowed to fly a maximum of 110 hours a month, which is more than the 100 hours in most other countries.

Last year seven commercial planes were damaged beyond repair around the world, according to Boeing data; two were in Indonesia, wrecked in non-fatal accidents involving Sriwijaya Air and Tri M.G. Airlines.

LATEST CRASH

Flight JT610 took off from Jakarta at 6:20 a.m. on Oct. 29, bound for Bangka island, off Sumatra, and plunged into the sea 13 minutes later. Just before the crash, the pilot asked to return to the airport.

The aircraft flew erratically on its previous flight and its airspeed readings were unreliable, according to an accident investigator and a flight tracking website.

Investigators on Monday said the flight data recorder from the downed jet showed an airspeed indicator had been damaged during its final four flights, raising questions about maintenance and mechanical problems.

Boeing said on Wednesday it had issued a bulletin to airlines reminding pilots about what it described as existing procedures for handling erroneous data from sensors.

The Federal Aviation Administration later issued a directive calling for revisions to “operating procedures of the airplane flight manual.”

It is too early for regulators to decide whether to reconsider the decision to remove Lion Air from the EU blacklist, EU Ambassador to Indonesia Vincent Guerend told Reuters.

“The European Commission continues to monitor the situation on a regular basis,” he said. “It is still too early to have any conclusive views on the causes of the accident.”

"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has made a $1 billion bid for a broad partnership with South African state-owned defense group Denel that would include acquisition of a minority stake in a joint venture with Germany’s Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE), a source familiar with the offer said.

Currently heavily dependent on imports, Saudi Arabia, the world’s third-largest defense spender, is seeking partnerships to develop its own domestic defense industry with the goal of localizing half of its military spending by 2030.

Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), the kingdom’s state defense company, told Reuters last month that it was in discussions with all major South African firms and aimed to conclude the first deals by the end of this year.

According to the source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, Saudi Arabia was targeting Denel’s 49 percent stake in Rheinmetall Denel Munition (RDM).

RDM is a South African-based joint venture formed in 2008 between Denel and Rheinmetall Waffe Munition GmbH, which holds the remaining 51 percent stake. It specializes in the development, design and manufacture of medium and large-caliber ammunition including artillery shells.

A Rheinmetall spokesman declined to comment. The German government is currently reviewing all arms sales to Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

Industry sources said RDM operates independently and is subject to South African law, which means exports from the unit are not subject to German government oversight. The sources said they did not expect that a change in the ownership of the venture would require a German government review.

Under the Saudi offer, SAMI would also finance research and development in other Denel divisions including Denel Dynamics, which develops and produces tactical missiles and precision guided weapons.

Denel and SAMI would share intellectual property and under a new joint venture would target defense export markets in the Middle East and North Africa.

Finally, Saudi Arabia - already a top Denel customer for military vehicles, artillery munitions and radar equipment - would purchase a certain amount of the group’s production. The Saudis expect an answer from the South African authorities by the end of December.

“Saudi Arabia has made a unique business proposition to the South African government. As our discussions are not finalised yet we cannot provide any comment,” SAMI CEO Andreas Schwer wrote in response to Reuters’ questions.

“RIPE FOR PARTNERSHIPS”

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last week said Denel was “ripe for joint-venture partnerships”. But he added that the government had not yet weighed the Saudi bid or proposals from what he said were a number of other suitors looking to partner with Denel.

A Denel spokesperson would not comment on any specific bid, saying that such negotiations take place on a state-to-state basis.

Ramaphosa’s spokeswoman Khusela Diko said the president would only make a decision on the Saudi offer to partner with Denel once it was discussed by cabinet.

“No decision has been made yet,” Diko told Reuters.

The source with knowledge of the Saudi bid told Reuters that Rheinmetall informally approached Denel’s board last year aiming to deepen its collaboration with the company.

The source said Rheinmetall had, like Saudi Arabia, expressed interest in acquiring Denel’s minority stake in RDM and other Denel divisions but was rebuffed.

Rheinmetall declined to comment.

Denel is grappling with an acute liquidity crunch and is struggling to pay salaries and deliver on roughly 18 billion rand ($1.29 billion) of outstanding orders.

Following seven years of modest profits, the company said last week it had made an operating loss of 1.7 billion rand in the 2017/18 financial year.

Sector observers say finding an equity partner is essential to Denel’s survival.

However, the interest in the company from Saudi Arabia, which is accused of committing abuses in the war in Yemen and has admitted responsibility for Khashoggi’s death, has spawned public debate in South Africa.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest defence company BAE Systems (BAES.L), which counts Saudi Arabia as its third biggest customer, stuck to a forecast for flat earnings in 2018 and said programmes in the UK and the United States were making progress.

BAE’s update is its first since companies have come under pressure for doing business with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.

BAE makes 16 percent of its annual sales from selling Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets and other arms to Saudi Arabia. It did not mention Saudi in its trading statement.

“Whilst a degree of geopolitical turbulence exists, the potential pipeline for Typhoon remains positive with opportunities both with partner nations and through exports,” the company said on Thursday.

The case has raised questions about the UK government’s 10 billion pound deal to sell Saudi Arabia 48 new Typhoons, which are made by BAE Systems and its partners.

The deal, confirmed in a memorandum of understanding in March, has not been finalised, and is not reflected in BAE’s 2018 financial statements.

BAE, which builds ships and fighter jets for the UK, and combat vehicles and other equipment for the United States, said that for 2018 earnings per share would be in line with the previous year, with some small additional benefit from exchange rates.

The company repeated a line it has given in the past that it saw limited impact on its business from Britain leaving the European Union as it had little trade with the EU.",Reuters,0
"MUNICH (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) bucked the trend of boardroom caution when it said on Thursday it expects to shrug off global geopolitical tensions and notch up “moderate” sales growth next year.

Chief Executive Joe Kaeser described the German engineering company’s guidance as “courageous”, saying it saw only limited risks and expected to increased sales in the 3 to 5 percent range during its 2019 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1.

The outlook was for “moderate growth”, he told Reuters TV after the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.

“The capital markets would likely interpret that as growth of between 3 and 5 percent,” he said.

The train-to-turbine maker’s shares rose 1.1 percent in early trading, bolstered by a new 3 billion euro ($3.43 billion) share buyback.

“If everybody is concerned, there has to be somebody who brings hope and shows people the way. This is not arrogant ... Our customers like what we do,” Kaeser said.

Many companies have voiced worries about slowing growth as trade tension between the United States and China mounts and economies in many countries ebb.

Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told an analysts’ call however that Siemens had good visibility for the first six months of its business year, and had not seen any negative indicators stemming from geopolitical tensions hitting its smaller and shorter-term projects.

Despite the upbeat comments, investment research firm CFRA cut its rating on the shares to ‘hold’ from ‘strong buy’.

“We think its outlook statement points to a tougher operating environment in FY19, on the back of rising macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical tension,” CFRA equity analyst Firdaus Ibrahim said in a note.

Siemens’ confidence contrasts with the troubles at its U.S. rival General Electric (GE.N) which last month slashed its dividend, said it faces a deepening federal accounting probe and vowed to restructure its power unit.

RIVALS’ WOES

Shares in Siemens’ Swiss rival ABB (ABBN.S) hit a nearly two-year low last month after the group reported third-quarter results. ABB turned more cautious on its European outlook, citing concerns about Italy and Britain.

Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) tried to ease mounting concerns about China and global demand last month after it affirmed its 2018 profit estimate, a move that investors feared signaled a cap in earnings growth and sparked a sell-off in its shares.

Kaeser, who is reorganizing Siemens to simplify its structure and speed up growth, was particularly buoyed by the strength in Siemens’ short-cycle businesses like its Digital Factory automation unit, the jewel in its crown.

During the three months ended Sept. 30, the division raised revenue by 10 percent and profit by 28 percent, helped by sales of its software business which controls industrial processes in factories.

Kaeser said he thought the business could continue to grow even in uncertain times and take market share.

But the Power and Gas business remained a sore spot, swinging to a loss of 139 million euros during the quarter as the collapse in demand for large gas-powered turbines persisted and it was hit by charges from cutting jobs.

The business, which competes with General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), has also seen falling prices due to over-capacity in the sector.

In September, Siemens said it would cut around 2,900 jobs in Germany to achieve 500 million euros in cost savings to improve the competitiveness of its Power and Gas division and the Process Industries and Drives division.

The overhaul triggered 301 million euros in restructuring charges which weighed on the Siemens’s industrial profit, which remained flat at 2.145 billion euros.

Siemens’ results were also hit by a one-off tax charge related to the separation of its mobility unit. Siemens is seeking approvals from competition authorities to combine the train business with France’s Alstom (ALSO.PA).

As a result, net profit fell 46 percent to 681 million euros, better than the 595 million euros expected in a Reuters poll.

Siemens proposed raising its dividend. Kaeser said its new share buyback would not prevent future acquisitions.

"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran is likely to ride out the storm from U.S. oil sanctions, suffering recession but no economic meltdown, thanks to rising crude prices and deepening divisions between the United States and other major powers, officials and analysts say.

“Iran’s situation is better than pre-2016 because of high oil prices and the fact that the U.S. is isolated this time,” said a European diplomat who asked not to be further identified.

Iran emerged in early 2016 from years of global sanctions under a deal with world powers that curbed its disputed nuclear program. But President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in May, calling it flawed to Iran’s advantage, and reimposed far-reaching U.S. sanctions in phases, with the most damaging oil and banking penalties taking effect on Nov. 5.

Trump aims to force Washington’s longtime adversary to accept tougher restrictions on its nuclear activity, drop its ballistic missile program and scale back support for militant proxies in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria.

But the broadly united front of world powers that enforced sanctions on Iran previously, pushing Iran into nuclear restraint, has unraveled since Trump took office and clashed with allies over everything from trade to collective security.

The other signatories to the nuclear deal - Germany, France, Britain, the European Union, Russia and China - have condemned Trump’s walkout from the pact. The EU is preparing a special mechanism to enable payments for Iranian oil and other exports without U.S. dollars, possibly through a barter system.

“It will be a difficult period but Iran’s economy will withstand it for various reasons,” a second diplomat said, “including (the fact of) Russia being under (U.S. and EU)sanctions, Saudi Arabia having its own financial and political issues, and (trade war) between China and the United States.”

Big power disunity and EU moves to circumvent Trump’s sanctions regime have given Tehran a psychological boost - but not dissuaded foreign businesses ranging from oil majors to trading houses and shipping concerns from pulling out of Iran for fear of incurring new U.S. penalties.

RECESSION BUT NO MELTDOWN

Still, while the U.S. clampdown will probably trigger recession in Iran next year, economic meltdown should be avoided, with a reduced but still significant volume of oil exports continuing, a Fitch solutions analyst said.

“Tehran is still likely to see a substantial share of its foreign exchange earnings maintained,” Andrine Skjelland told Reuters. “This will enable Tehran to continue subsidizing imports of selected basic goods, keeping the costs of these down and thus limiting inflation to some extent.”

In hopes of mitigating the immediate economic hit, Iranian authorities have hinted that Tehran might have to sell its oil at a discount to entice buyers going forward.

“Oil revenues might decline but (they) will still be enough to run the country,” said an official involved in Iran’s international commerce. “If we sell our oil for $1 less than market price, it will have tens of buyers.”

In another counter-measure made possible by state control of the oil sector, Iranian authorities are using special exchange centers to sell dollars at cheaper rates to importers of basic foods, medicine and other essential goods.

IHS Markit senior economist Patrick Schneider doubted that Iran could cushion the economic blow in the near term.

“Despite the rhetoric and attempts to mitigate the downside effects..., uncertainty will remain prevalent for the next 6-12 months,” he told Reuters.

The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran’s economy will contract in 2018 by 1.5 percent and by 3.6 percent in 2019 due to the dwindling of oil revenues.

At the same time the World Bank anticipates inflation in Iran jumping to 23.8 percent in 2018-19 from 9.6 percent in 2017-18, and to 31.2 percent in 2019-20.

DEFIANCE

But Iranian officials are defiant, citing Trump’s isolation in repudiating the nuclear deal, climbing oil prices and Trump’s agreement to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries especially dependent on Iranian crude.

“Crude prices are rising. Even if Iran’s oil sales drop to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), we will be able to run the economy. But we will send much more than that. Our economy will be far from collapse,” said a senior Iranian official.

“Our budget is based on oil of $57 per barrel and is now over $75 per barrel.”

In October, Iran’s crude exports were estimated at 1.82 million bpd by data intelligence company Kpler and 1.5 million bpd by another firm that traces Iranian shipments.

Trump granted 180-day sanctions waivers to China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey, which together took in over 80 percent of Iran oil exports last year, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.

“Even without the exemptions, we will sell our oil. We will bypass sanctions. We have so many countries that are on our side. America cannot do a damn thing,” said a senior official close to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The sanctions, however, will inevitably erode Iran’s state finances and raise already high inflation and jobless rates, making life harder for ordinary Iranians.

Since May, when Trump took Washington out of the nuclear deal, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the value of the rial currency has plunged.

The rial’s weakness has sent prices of some imports rocketing, destroying jobs as some factories using imported parts have folded. Around 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have begun to close down in the past few months due to scarcity of raw materials and hard currency, according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA.

Moreover, Trump’s sanctions against Iran’s financial sector essentially make 30 banks and their subsidiaries off-limits to foreign lenders, undermining its means to facilitate trade.

Still, Iran demonstrated considerable resilience and ingenuity in coping with earlier international sanctions, and there is little to suggest Tehran could not do this again.

While ordinary Iranians struggled, Iran’s clerical and security establishment and business world sought kept the economy running by means including resorting to barter as well as foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar.",Reuters,0

DUBAI (Reuters) - Israel and Gulf Arab states should cooperate on aviation security and other civilian areas such as transportation, commercial aviation and tourism, Israel’s intelligence minister told Reuters on Thursday after a visit to Oman.

Israel Katz, who is also transport minister, was in the Omani capital Muscat this week attending a transportation conference. His visit came less than two weeks after a rare visit to the Gulf state by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet ruler Sultan Qaboos bin Said al-Said.

“In my view cooperation between Israel and the Gulf states can and should be expanded ... ,” Katz told Reuters by email. “Israel also has a lot to offer when it comes to water desalination and irrigation, agriculture and medicine.”

There are no commercial passenger flights between Israel and any of the six Gulf states, though Air India this year started flights to Tel Aviv from India that seemed to lift a 70-year-old ban on flights to or from Israel from using Saudi airspace.

Israel only has diplomatic relations with two Arab states, Egypt and Jordan, though Netanyahu has on several occasions hinted at warmer relations with Gulf Arab states.

Israel sees the Gulf state as natural allies against regional powerhouse Iran.

Katz said recent public visits by Israeli ministers to the Gulf “are part of a wider trend of strengthening ties between Israel and the Gulf countries based on common interests and a mutual recognition of the potential benefits for both sides, both in terms of contending with common challenges and threats as well as opportunities”.

Israeli’s army said in February it had stopped an “aerial attack abroad by Islamic State”, which Israeli media said at the time referred to the failed attempted bombing of an Etihad Airways flight in Australia in 2017.

The frail 87-year-old was physically helped by aides to a cinema hall to watch the premiere in Russia of a new documentary about his life, his Soviet reforms in the 1980s and his arms control drive that helped end the Cold War.

His legacy has come under a pall as ties between Moscow and Washington have fallen to post-Cold War lows, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and rows over sanctions, election meddling and the poisoning of a spy in England.

He spoke briefly to a cinema hall in Moscow after “Meeting Gorbachev”, a new documentary directed by filmmakers Werner Herzog and Andre Singer, and was asked if the world would hold back from a new Cold War.

“We must hold back,” he said. “And not just from the Cold War. We have to continue the course we mapped. We have to ban war once and for all. Most important is to get rid of nuclear weapons.”

Reviled by many Russians as the man whose reforms ultimately led to the Soviet breakup, Gorbachev is lauded in the West as the man who helped end the Cold War.

Gorbachev, whose visibly ailing health was in stark contrast to the vigorous reformist figure he cut in the 1980s, said the world was moving dangerously closer to a new arms race.

Last month in a column for the New York Times, Gorbachev denounced the United States after President Donald Trump said he planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty which Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan signed in 1987.

The pact eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe.

In a prepared, written message read out to the hall by an aide before the film, Gorbachev alluded to the article and said “I am convinced we can stop a new Cold War. I will do everything for this.”

"(Reuters) - Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) said on Thursday it would sell two businesses for around $900 million (£689 million) and cut 5,000 jobs and as it expands its stronger corporate jet and rail divisions, but the company’s shares fell as much as 26 percent on a disappointing free cash flow forecast.

The Canadian plane and train maker said it would only be able to meet its 2018 free cash flow estimate by using $635 million in proceeds from the sale of a Toronto plant earlier this year. Analysts had expected Montreal-based Bombardier to achieve its target of roughly breaking even on cash without relying on those proceeds.

“2018 free cash flow was lower than my expectations,” said Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins.

Jamie Koutsoukis, a senior analyst at Moody’s, said by email she believes Bombardier has “an uncertain ability to generate positive free cash flow in 2019.”

Bombardier Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert attributed the free cash flow discrepancy to higher-than-expected working capital needs in its rail division.

Bombardier had to invest more than expected this year on inventory for rail contracts, but will receive the bulk of the payments only upon completion of those orders, a Bombardier spokesman confirmed by email.

The latest round of layoffs, which accounts for over 7 percent of its global workforce, will save Bombardier about $250 million by 2021, it said. About half the cuts, or 2,500 layoffs, were announced for the Canadian province of Quebec, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said in a statement.

In 2016, Quebec’s government invested a billion dollars in the company’s former CSeries jetliner program, before control of the plane passed to Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) this year.

In Northern Ireland unions vowed in a statement to fight to save jobs.

Canada’s Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said in Ottawa he was “disappointed” by the job losses. His government announced C$372.5 million ($283.08 million) in repayable loans for two Bombardier jet programs last year.

Chief Executive Alain Bellemare told analysts on a conference call the changes would allow the company to pursue “growth opportunities” in its stronger-performing rail, business jet and aerostructures divisions.

Bombardier, while slashing thousands of jobs in 2016, also hired workers to develop its Global 7500 business jet, a major revenue driver.

The company also said it was selling its Q400 turboprop program to a unit of Longview Aviation Capital for $300 million, confirming earlier reports, and its corporate aircraft training business to CAE Inc (CAE.TO) for $645 million.

In a statement, Longview said it would continue operating the Q400’s Toronto assembly site until at least 2021, but could not give further details on the program’s future.

The sale comes as Bombardier undertakes a five-year restructuring program through 2020.

Bombardier said it would try to turn its money-losing regional jet program around by slashing costs, and boosting volumes, but would also explore strategic options for the program.

Earlier on Thursday, Bombardier forecast 2019 revenue would grow by 10 percent to $18 billion or more, driven by a pickup in deliveries of Global 7500 jets. Adjusted earnings per share of 4 cents beat estimates of 2 cents a share according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Its mid-life upgrade, costing 1.3 billion euros (£1.13 billion), largely focussed on modernising facilities for landing and guiding aircraft. That came after heavy use given the retirement of Britain’s carrier and intense operations between 2015-2016 in the fight against Islamic State militants.

President Emmanuel Macron will spend a night on the vessel next week as it ramps up its five-week pre-deployment training phase.

Faced with the “profound change in the naval strategic panorama”, including the expansionist aims of Beijing in the South China Sea, France considers the aircraft carrier of incomparable “tactical and political value”, said Admiral Christophe Prazuck, Chief of Staff of the French Navy.",Reuters,0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. arms sales to foreign governments rose 13 percent to $192.3 billion in the year ending Sept. 30, the State Department said on Thursday, a result of looser restrictions on sales coupled with high-level efforts to close deals.

President Donald Trump wants to make the United States, already dominant in the global weapons trade, an even bigger arms merchant to the world, U.S. officials have said, despite concerns among human rights and arms control advocates.

The largest U.S. arms contractors, who sell ships, tanks, airplanes, missiles and other goods to foreign militaries, include Boeing Co (BA.N), Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), Raytheon Co (RTN.N), General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).

The increase came in part because the Trump administration rolled out a new “Buy American” plan in April that relaxed restrictions on sales while encouraging U.S. officials to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry.

There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. companies: direct commercial sales, negotiated between a government and a company; and foreign military sales, in which a foreign government works with the Pentagon on a potential deal. Both require approval by the U.S. government.

Commercial sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments rose 6.6 percent from $128.1 billion to $136.6 billion in the fiscal year, the State Department said.

In October, the government said U.S. foreign military sales rose 33 percent to $55.6 billion in the fiscal year.

Combined, the total is a 13 percent year-on-year increase in weapons exports.",Reuters,0

"GMR Aero Technic is considering venturing into widebody maintenance as it seeks to expand its workshop capability.

The Indian MRO operator is looking at possibly maintaining the Airbus A330, as well as the Boeing 777 and 787 types, its chief marketing officer Girish Deshmukh tells FlightGlobal at the MRO Asia event held in Singapore.

For the firm to be able to offer widebody maintenance, it will however first need to train its engineers and technicians to be certified for such works, and to acquire the necessary tools.

GMR now has the capability to conduct heavy maintenance works on narrowbodies such as the A320s and 737s, as well as the ATR 72 and Bombardier Q400 turboprops at its three hangars located at Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International airport. These hangars can accommodate up five narrowbodies and two turboprops simultaneously. It could repurpose one of the hangars for widebody maintenance.

Deshmukh says GMR has no plans to venture into engine maintenance since it would require a minimum investment of $50 million, having the necessary expertise, and the transfer of intellectual property from OEMs to the MRO operator. He also notes that engine OEMs have yet to express an interest in setting up such facilities in India.

He adds that Indian MRO operators continue to face personnel issues including lack of specialists, and the poaching of experienced engineers and technicians by Middle Eastern companies. Other challenges include the government's 18% tax on sale of services to foreign aircraft doing maintenance in India.

Despite the hurdles, GMR believes that it has several advantages over its competitors.

Being based at Hyderabad, located between north and south India, presents the firm with good opportunities for new businesses within a four-hour flying radius. Rajiv Gandhi International airport is also within a special economic zone, which means it could pass on some cost savings to customers.

GMR believes that demand for airframe, components, and engine maintenance will grow as Indian operators are set to operate more than 1,500 aircraft by 2028.",Flight Global,0

"First flight of the A330-800 on 6 November was a significant milestone for Airbus. As well as confirming the progress of the second and last of its A330neo variants, it also apparently draws a line under Toulouse’s current product development efforts.

Airbus’s product development and engineering teams find themselves in an unprecedented situation, with no more major airliner variants on the drawing board – officially at least.

Since the introduction of the A350-900 in 2015, there has been a flurry of new arrivals coming through the Airbus pipeline. But that is about to end – and even over in Montreal, the recently-added A220 programme is through its development phase.

But the situation in Seattle is potentially very different. Not only is Boeing still progressing through the 737 Max variants and about to start 777X flight testing, but has the clean-sheet New Mid-market Airplane ready to go.

The prospect of a “797” becoming a reality must be a catalyst for Airbus. The most likely response seems to be the “A321XLR” – an A321neo derivative about which there has been much talk, but so far little detail.

How Airbus decides to counter the NMA will be crucial. Toulouse will not need reminding that the last time it went up against an all-new Boeing with a ­re-engined best-seller, things didn’t end well.",Flight Global,0
"On the surface, this year’s Airshow China was much the same as in 2016. A Sino-Russian joint venture had a mock-up of a new widebody, the CR929, and the Comac ARJ21 garnered its customary orders from a Chinese lessor. Western suppliers had their usual big presence, jockeying for workshare on Chinese programmes.

But in fact, a great deal has changed over the past 24 months.

A US-China trade war has escalated, although it has yet to have much impact on the former’s aerospace firms. While Beijing has ratcheted up tariffs on smaller aircraft, it appears – so far – loathe to do so for the big jets going to its state-controlled carriers.

At Zhuhai, the big Western firms made obligatory public relations remarks about valuing Chinese partnerships and opportunities, but the long-term challenge Beijing represents can no longer be ignored.

On the flagship CR929, local and Russian suppliers will be favoured over Western ones, ostensibly due to concerns about tariffs and other restrictions. Left unmentioned is Beijing’s continued ambition to build its own aerospace industry.

The show followed damning remarks about China by US Vice President Mike Pence. Among other things, he accused Beijing of stealing foreign industrial secrets.

Shortly after the speech, the US Department of Justice levied charges against alleged Chinese spies, accusing them of appropriating confidential information from US aerospace companies.

Beijing’s relaxed attitude to intellectual property has long been an issue for industry, but the US allegations raise uncomfortable questions for the future.

There are already hints about how Chinese aerospace supremacy will change the sector. One comes from the unmanned air vehicle industry, where, unbridled by restrictive treaties, Beijing has sold hundreds of armed UAVs, including some to dubious regimes.

Another such hint comes from Beijing’s tremendous investment in advanced weapons, sensors and secure networks. To a large degree, such capabilities are being enabled by Western technology transfer.

Having profited from its rise, Western aerospace firms will find it uncomfortable viewing Beijing as an existential threat. But an urgent re-think of China’s role in the global aerospace sector is essential. It is time to drop the fantasy that it is a benign partner, and see it as a rival that plays by its own rules.",Flight Global,0
"Sales of regional jets and turboprops are more limited in frequency and scale than for the mainliner sector, and particularly narrowbodies like the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. Our data shows that during the first nine months of this year, net orders for aircraft in these two categories totalled just 125 aircraft, versus 883 mainliners.

Positive developments so far in 2018 have included Embraer in April handing over the first E190-E2: a rewinged, re-engined update to its successul E-Jet series. Three are now in use with Norwegian carrier Widerøe, but over the 12-month period of our review, the Brazilian airframer’s total orders for the three-member E2-family contracted by 30 units.

Sukhoi Civil Aircraft appears set to add a further 100 Superjet 100s to its backlog, after Aeroflot announced plans to acquire more examples, for delivery from next year. This good news was tempered, however, by public criticism from Mexican carrier Interjet, its only operator in the Americas, which said it could be prepared to sell its fleet.

Mitsubishi Aircraft’s delayed MRJ seems to be making good progress with flight testing, although a 20-unit commitment has been lost and a financial bail-out was required from its parent company to retain hopes of a 2020 entry into service.

Growing freight demand also delivered a boost to the sector, with FedEx Express having helped to launch both the ATR 72-600F and the Cessna SkyCourier 408 freighter. The latter will also come as a 19-seat passenger transport, registering at the lower limit of our regional aircraft classification. Our directory also this year gains RUAG Aviation’s Dornier 228NG and the Viking Air Twin Otter Series 400, which have the same seating capacity.

Exclusions include projects about which there is a lack of information on orders and deliveries, or where production is made for military customers. This includes Indonesian Aerospace’s 28-seat NC212i and 19-seat N219. Also dropping out is the TRJet 328/723: the status of which appears uncertain, due to rival Turkish Aerospace disclosing plans to develop a “100-seat-plus” jet for Ankara.

The regional aircraft landscape could change substantially before our next World Airliner Directory is produced, with Embraer and Boeing eyeing a possible joint venture. The proposal’s outcome could be determined as soon as December, with the E-Jet and E2 lines to be affected either way.

"Airbus and Leonardo will in future use dollars as their accounting reference for their component supplies to their ATR joint venture in a bid to reduce currency-related headwinds for the twin-turboprop manufacturer.

Leonardo finance chief Alessandra Genco said during an 8 November results briefing that a decline in the dollar's value relative to the euro between January and September – versus the same period in 2017 – was one of several factors that led to reduced earnings at ATR.

The Toulouse-based joint venture has previously calculated costs using the euro, while aircraft are priced in dollars.

Genco says that a proportion of ATR's expenses – ""mainly personnel costs"" – will continue to be accounted in euros.

Nine-month revenue in Leonardo's aeronautics division – comprising aerostructures and aircraft production – declined 6.9%, to €2.03 billion ($2.3 billion).

Earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation were down 14.4%, to €167 million, which Genco attributes to a ""softness"" at ATR.

In addition to currency effects, the turboprop manufacturer generated lower-margin sales than last year and delivered fewer aircraft than previously planned, Genco says.

She notes that a reduction in aircraft deliveries to Iran Air – following the US government's reinstatement of sanctions against the country – has resulted in a lower financial performance at ATR.

Leonardo chief executive Alessandro Profumo says that he sees ""no light at the end of the tunnel"" in terms of returning the aerostructures operation to profitability.

But he says the division has turned a corner in terms of its industrial performance. Previous quality issues with the production of Boeing 787 components have been resolved and, Profumo says, Leonardo is no longer on ""probation"" with the US manufacturer over the supply of 767 structures.

He adds that discussions are still ongoing with Airbus about a revision of terms for the supply of A220 parts. The talks began with Bombardier when the Canadian manufacturer controlled the programme, previously known as the CSeries.

“There is nowhere left to search and we have stopped finding victims’ bodies,” Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the national search and rescue agency (Basarnas) told media. “We will limit our operations to monitoring.”

The nearly new Boeing Co. 737 MAX passenger plane crashed into the sea on Oct. 29 just minutes after taking off from Jakarta en route to Bangka island near Sumatra.

Syaugi said 196 body bags containing human remains had been retrieved and 77 victims identified after forensic examination.

Authorities have downloaded data from one of the black boxes found last week, the flight data recorder, but are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder.

Soearjanto Tjahjono, the head of the transportation safety committee (KNKT), said finding the voice recorder would be critical to understanding the cause of the crash.

“From the black box data, we know about 70-80 percent of what happened but to 100-percent understand the cause of the accident... we need be able to know the conversation that took place in the plane’s cockpit,” he said, declining to elaborate on what the flight data recorder had revealed.

KNKT has brought in a pinger locator and a vessel capable of sucking up mud to help with the search for the voice recorder, in addition to remotely operated underwater vehicles equipped with cameras.

Tjahjono said he was worried the cockpit voice recorder may have been damaged on impact because KNKT had yet to detect any “ping” sounds that would indicate its location, as had happened with the first black box.

He said authorities were searching for 15 aircraft parts, including an “angle of attack” sensor on the aircraft, which helps the plane’s computers understand if the aircraft is stable. Investigators have said one of these sensors had provided erroneous data.

"PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and France’s Emmanuel Macron agreed on Saturday on the need for more European defence spending, papering over an earlier Trump tweet that had described Macron’s call for a European army as “very insulting”.

Meeting for talks at the Elysee a day before commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One, Macron welcomed Trump under rainy Parisian skies with a firm handshake. But there appeared to be less immediate warmth in the greeting between the two than in the past.

Seated on gilded chairs in the ornate presidential palace, Macron placed his hand on Trump’s knee and referred to him as “my friend”, while Trump kept more distance, although he also talked up common ground on an issue that had caused friction.

“We want a strong Europe, it’s very important to us, and whichever way we can do it the best and more efficient would be something we both want,” said Trump.

“We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now the burden sharing has been largely on the United States.”

Macron echoed those sentiments, saying he wanted Europe to bear a greater share of the defence costs within NATO, a point he has made repeatedly since taking office, alongside his ambitions for Europe to have its own military capability.

“That’s why I do believe my proposals for European defence are totally consistent with that,” Macron said in English.

Fresh off U.S. congressional elections that saw his Republican Party’s power eroded, Trump’s visit is aimed at bolstering the U.S.-European alliance at a symbolic time, with the world marking the centenary of World War One’s armistice.

But in a tweet prior to landing in Paris, Trump took a dim view of comments Macron made in a Europe 1 radio interview this week in which he appeared to cast the United States as a threat.

Discussing the growing dangers from cyber-hacking, meddling in electoral processes and the U.S. decision to withdraw from a missile treaty, Macron said Europe needed to protect itself against China, Russia “and even the United States”.

Later in the interview he spoke about the need for a European army, saying:

“Faced by Russia, which is on our borders and which has shown that it can be threatening... we need to have a Europe that can better defend itself by itself, without depending solely on the United States.”

Trump, who has pushed NATO allies to pay more for common defence and not rely on the United States, complained.

“Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly,” Trump said on Twitter.

The Elysee said the misunderstanding, which it said had been caused by “exaggerated” U.S. press reports, was cleared up during more than an hour of talks it described as “substantial” and “very constructive”.

“We had a great discussion and we are aligned,” the Elysee quoted Trump as saying during the meeting, which covered trade, defence, Syria and the fallout from the murder in Istanbul last month of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

SOLEMN COMMEMORATION

After a lunch with Macron and their wives, Melania and Brigitte, Trump was scheduled to visit an American cemetery at Belleau Wood, east of Paris. But he cancelled the trip due to the weather. White House chief of staff John Kelly, a retired four-star general, and General Joe Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will attend the ceremony instead, the White House said.

On Sunday, after a solemn commemoration at the Arc de Triomphe to honour the armistice centenary, Trump is scheduled to visit an American cemetery at Suresnes, on the western outskirts of the capital, where he will make formal remarks.

His trip comes just days after congressional elections delivered results that will complicate his next two years. While Republicans slightly expanded their majority in the U.S. Senate, they lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives to Democrats who may use their newfound power to launch investigations into Trump and stymie his agenda.

While the talks with Trump covered trade and foreign policy, it was not clear if they touched on European concerns about Trump’s plans to withdraw the United States from the 1980s Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Agreement.

Macron told Europe 1 radio that the “main victim” of the U.S. withdrawal from the INF accord was Europe and its security.

"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and the United States have agreed to end U.S. refuelling of aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition battling Houthi insurgents in Yemen, halting a divisive aspect of U.S. support to a war that has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.

The move, announced by the coalition on Saturday and confirmed by Washington, comes at a time when Riyadh, already under scrutiny for civilian deaths in Yemen air strikes, is facing global furore and potential sanctions over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2.

The United States and Britain late last month called for a ceasefire in Yemen to support U.N.-led efforts to end the nearly four-year long war that has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis.

“Recently, the Kingdom and the Coalition increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refuelling in Yemen. As a result, in consultation with the United States, the Coalition has requested the cessation of inflight refuelling support for its operations in Yemen,” it said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia has a fleet of 23 planes for refuelling operations, including six Airbus 330 MRTT used for Yemen, while the United Arab Emirates has six of the Airbus planes, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya al-Hadath channel reported on Saturday.

Riyadh also has nine KC-130 Hercules aircraft that can be used, it added.

U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said the U.S. government was consulted on the decision and that Washington supported the move while continuing to work with the alliance to minimise civilian casualties and expand humanitarian efforts.

Any co-ordinated decision by Washington and Riyadh could be an attempt to forestall action threatened in Congress next week by lawmakers over refuelling operations.

However, a halt to refuelling could have little practical effect on the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Only a fifth of coalition aircraft require in-air refuelling from the United States, U.S. officials said.

BATTLE FOR HODEIDAH

The Sunni Muslim alliance led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE has recently stepped up military operations against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement, including in the main port city of Hodeidah, which is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis.

“The continued escalation of attacks ... by the U.S.-Saudi-Emirati coalition confirms that the American calls for a cease-fire are nothing but empty talk,” Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the group’s supreme revolutionary committee, wrote in a column published by the Washington Post on Friday.

He said the ceasefire call was an attempt “to save face after the humiliation” caused by the murder of Washington Post columnist Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policy, that has strained Riyadh’s relationship with the West.

The leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah group, which Saudi Arabia accuses of backing the Houthis, said calls from the United States, Europe and the U.N. for a ceasefire in Yemen “were good to hear” but could also be a trick aimed at timewasting.

“I say to our brothers there: Be patient, be steadfast … You are closer to victory than at any previous time,” Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for an immediate end to the military escalation in Yemen.

“The Saudi-led Coalition and pro-Hadi forces, the Houthi forces – and those who supply arms or other support to the parties to the conflict – all have the power or the influence to stop the starvation and killing of civilians, to give some reprieve to the people of Yemen,” Bachelet said in a statement on Saturday.

The statement also said there is concern over 900 detainees in the central prison in Hodeidah and six pre-trial detention facilities after it was hit on Monday by two mortar shells, injuring five and cutting off power and water to the prison.

Hodeidah has become a key battleground in the war in which the coalition intervened in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government ousted by the Houthis.

U.N. bodies warn that an all-out attack on the Red Sea port, an entry point for 80 percent of Yemen’s food imports and aid relief, could trigger a famine in the impoverished country.

The World Food Programme said on Thursday it planned to double food assistance for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people “to avert mass starvation”.

Air strikes by the coalition, which relies on Western arms and intelligence, have often hit schools, hospitals and markets, killing thousands of Yemeni civilians.

U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths hopes to convene Yemen’s warring parties for peace talks by the end of the year.

The coalition expressed hope in its statement that his efforts would lead to a negotiated settlement, including an end to Houthi missile attacks that have targeted Saudi cities and vessels off the port of Hodeidah.

Mattis said all parties support Griffiths’ efforts.

“The U.S. and the Coalition are planning to collaborate on building up legitimate Yemeni forces to defend the Yemeni people, secure their country’s borders, and contribute to counter Al Qaeda and ISIS efforts in Yemen and the region,” he said in a statement.

"A pilot sacked for being scared of flying has won an unfair dismissal claim after a tribunal heard he was told to do a crossword when he raised concern about his phobia.

First officer Matthew Guest has been working for Flybe for almost a decade but became anxious and had ""panic attacks"" after being promoted to longer flights, a tribunal heard.

On one occasion Mr Guest twice raised concerns with a boss about a four hour flight but was told to do a crossword or read a book whilst the plane was cruising. He called in sick the next day and has not flown since.

An employment judge has now ruled he should have been offered alternative roles or at least an opportunity to discuss his case with group chief operating officer Luke Farajallah.

The father of two is now asking to be re-employed by the budget airline as his remedy for unfair dismissal. Unless the parties agree the matter will be decided by a judge later this month.

PARIS (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it made sense for a powerful economic bloc like the European Union to want to defend itself militarily.

The comments came after U.S. President Donald Trump fired off a tweet as he arrived in Paris on Friday in which he described a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for a European army as “very insulting”.

“Europe is a powerful economic entity, a powerful economic union and it is quite natural that it wants to be independent, self-sufficient and sovereign in matters of defence and security,” Putin told RT television.

Trump had taken a dim view of comments Macron made in a Europe 1 radio interview this week in which he appeared to cast the United States as a threat.

Discussing the growing danger from cyber-hacking, outside meddling in electoral processes and the U.S. decision to withdraw from a missile treaty, Macron said Europe needed to protect against China, Russia “and even the United States”.

Later in the same interview he spoke of the need for a European army, saying: “Faced by Russia, which is on our borders and which has shown that it can be threatening... we need to have a Europe that can better defend itself by itself, without depending solely on the United States.”

After they met on Saturday, Trump and Macron sought to paper over any differences, saying they agreed on the need for Europe to spend more on defence.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean military transport aircraft began a tangerine airlift to North Korea on Sunday, the first of a gift of 200 tonnes of the fruit from the southern island of Jeju, South Korea’s presidential Blue House said.

The present comes after the North Koreans gave South Korean President Moon Jae-in two tonnes of pricey pine mushrooms after a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in September.

North Korea has pursued nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. sanctions and South Korean officials said last week they had tested the mushrooms for radiation after an opposition lawmaker complained.

The Jeju tangerines were packed in 20,000 boxes and will be flown to Pyongyang by four C-130 aircraft during multiple flights on Sunday and Monday, the Blue House said in a statement.

Several senior South Korean officials, including Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung and presidential secretary for unification policy Suh Ho, flew to Pyongyang to deliver the first shipment.

North Korean leader Kim faces continued international pressure over his weapons programmes.

He vowed to work towards denuclearisation during his historic June summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, but Pyongyang’s actions have fallen short of U.S. demands for irreversible steps to scrap its arsenal, including a full disclosure of nuclear facilities and materials.

That has left inter-Korean efforts limited by international and unilateral sanctions that bar many forms of economic interaction with North Korea.

But South and North Korea have conducted a number of inter-Korean projects designed to lower tensions, including joint sports and cultural events, closing some guardposts along their shared border, and regular high-level negotiations.",Reuters,0

The Israeli incursion and air attacks drew rocket fire from the Hamas-controlled enclave, with sirens sounding in Israeli communities along the border. The military said its defences intercepted two of the launches. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage on the Israeli side of the frontier.

The violence prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut short a visit to Paris, where he had been gathering with world leaders for a World War One commemoration.

Hamas said the incident began when assailants in a passing car opened fire on a group of its armed men, killing one of its commanders. Hamas gunmen gave chase as the car sped back towards the border with Israel, Hamas said in a statement.

During the pursuit, Israeli aircraft fired more than 40 missiles in the area, according to witnesses.

Medics and Hamas officials said at least seven people were killed, four of them militants, including Hamas commander Nour Baraka. It was unclear if the other fatalities included gunmen.

"ATR has completed a demonstration tour of its ATR 42-600 in several Chinese cities, as it attempts to re-enter the promising China market.

The aircraft visited several airports in Yunnan province, including those in Diqing, Lijiang and Kunming, to demonstrate its capability in high-altitude and mountainous environments. The manufacturer says the turboprop took off and landed from the airport in Diqing, which is 3,287m above sea level, and the highest altitude airport that an ATR 42-600 has served and is certified for.

“No other aircraft in production could regularly serve Diqing in a general aviation configuration and this highlights its remarkable versatility and performance, even in ‘hot and high’ conditions, surrounded by challenging terrain,” says ATR chief executive Stefano Bortoli. He describes the type as the “perfect modern solution” to enhance China’s regional connectivity.

The turboprop, which has the words ""highland eagle"" in Mandarin on its livery, was on static display at Airshow China last week. It departed the show for the tour on 7 November.

ATR is forecasting a demand for 1,100 turboprops in the 30-70 seat category over the next 20 years in China, the vast majority of which will be to open new routes.

At the 2017 Paris air show, ATR signed LOIs with Shaanxi Tianju Investment for 10 ATR 42s, and Xuzhou Hantong Aviation for three of the type. The manufacturer is attempting the strategy of using smaller start-ups to gain a foothold in the China market.

The first ATR entered service in China in 1997 with China Xinjiang Airlines, which had orders for five ATR 72-500s. The carrier was taken over by China Southern Airlines in 2003, which continued operating the turboprops until 2010 before selling them to Nordic Aviation Capital a year later, marking the exit of ATR turboprops from China.",Flight Global,0
"Airbus is looking at taking the maximum take-off weight of the A321neo above 100t in order to extend the range of the type beyond that of the new A321LR.

But the airframer believes it can achieve the hike by incorporating minimum changes to the basic airframe.

A320 family programme manager Klaus Roewe, speaking to FlightGlobal in Hamburg during the first A321LR customer delivery, indicated the current direction of studies on potential A321neo evolution. The A321LR has a MTOW of 97t and a range of 4,000nm.

Roewe confirms the ‘A321XLR’ tag for the extended-range study, and says that the airframer is looking at a MTOW above 100t and to push the range by another 700nm.

But he states that the aircraft could use the “same wing” and would probably need “no significant changes” beyond local reinforcement, including a strengthened landing-gear.

“It’s largely about more fuel,” he says. The A321neo is fitted either with CFM International Leap-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines, and Roewe indicates that the A321XLR could use the same powerplants.

Roewe says the airframer is primarily examining means to raise the fuel capacity. He does not believe the A321XLR would require a weight-saving programme beyond the efforts which Airbus is already incorporating as standard.

But he also stresses that the proposal still amounts to a study, and there is no timeline for any firm decision.

“We’re not under pressure,” he says, pointing out that Airbus has “options” for the aircraft.

Airbus single-aisle family product marketing director Franck Navallon says the airframer is “looking at many things”.

“As soon as the market is asking, we’re studying,” he says, adding that different airlines have different range objectives.

“People like Aer Lingus are very happy with the A321LR,” he says. “Lufthansa, being a bit further down into Europe, is telling us [they’d] like a bit more.”

Navallon says the A321neo wing is “fine for supporting more improvements”, although the airframer has yet to determine the details.

He also reiterates that the proposals are “studies”, and that studies are not the only part of the thought process. “We need to go for the business case,” he says.",Flight Global,0
"Subcontracting and joint bids are being studied as part of the recently announced co-operation between Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance and GMF AeroAsia.

Speaking to FlightGlobal at the recent MRO Asia event, business and base operations director Tazar Kurniawan says that the two companies are undertaking a six month study to explore how they might work together.

""This [partnership] will strengthen our position on airframe maintenance. Also, they have customers in this [region for] components. That means they can use our workshops to serve their customers in Asia,"" he explains.

The October agreement between the two companies followed on from earlier subcontracting work that GMF had done on behalf of AFI KLM E&M.

Having secured an industrial partner, the company has put on hold plans to secure a strategic investor. Kurniawan attributed the decision on weak market conditions.

GMF had intended to sell 20% of its stake to the strategic investor, through the issue of a new 10% stake and 89% shareholder Garuda Indonesia selling down 10% of its stake.

""It used to be that GMF was seeking [an investment] partnership... that includes private equity and industrial players. But considering that the moment is not good for us to sell our shares, we've proceeded with securing a strategic partner with an industrial player first, just to leverage on GMF's [strengths],"" explains Kurniawan.

"Boeing believes that pursuing strategic partnerships in Asia-Pacific will help it to tap the region's growing demand for MRO services.

In an email interview, Boeing Global Sservices vice-president of commercial connected programmes Ed Clark tells FlightGlobal that forming joint ventures with airlines or OEMs can be beneficial in select countries, through the sharing of risk and expertise, as well as gaining cost efficiencies and market access. At the same time, MRO companies working closely with airlines or suppliers over an extended contract can benefit from lower prices, gaining new and additional expertise, and offer a guaranteed work statement.

In Asia, it has formed partnerships with SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC) for Boeing Asia Pacific Aviation Services (BAPAS), which provides technical, component-based and maintenance services for Boeing aircraft.

Boeing Shanghai Aviation Services - a joint venture with Shanghai Airport Authority and China Eastern Airlines - conducts freighter conversions, upgrades to aircraft interiors, avionics, and entertainment systems, as well as line maintenance and heavy maintenance checks.

Elsewhere, Boeing works with airline and supplier-affiliated MROs to support the Global Fleet Care programme.

Asked if Boeing would consider having more dedicated facilities in Asia similar to that of BSAS, Clark indicates that BGS is open to making acquisitions and forming partnerships ""when it makes sense for our business and industry"".

On ways that airlines and the aviation industry can benefit from BGS, Clark touted the breadth of its products and services ""few in the industry can match"", and the use of its AnalytX product to create new products based on customer's need.

""Data insights, informed by our OEM knowledge and analytics prowess result in faster flow times, lower operational costs, and enhanced end-to-end reliability. Boeing is able to predict necessary aircraft maintenance, ensuring the relevant experts are ready and parts are sourced – positioning them in the right place at the right time,"" says Clark.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was reviewing details surrounding the safety data and conclusions the company previously provided to it as part of certifying 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models.

Flyadeal, a subsidiary of state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, had been due to decide on the order for 30 Airbus A320neos or Boeing 737 MAXs in the second quarter but held off to further assess the performance of the revamped models.

“We want some evidence because we’re committing a huge chunk of capital,” Con Korfiatis told Reuters at a Dubai conference, adding that the planemakers had competed “very vigorously”.

Flyadeal is a pure low cost airline, with passengers charged for meals and checked luggage, a model that has so far not had major success in the Middle East beyond United Arab Emirates-headquartered Air Arabia AIRA.DU.

The order for the planes, which are the latest versions of world’s most used jets and typically employed for short to medium haul flights, would be worth more than $3 billion at current list prices, although industry sources say discounts of around 50 percent are common on such large orders.

Although the world’s two largest planemakers say they are mostly sold out of the jets until 2024, the order will give flyadeal a pipeline allowing it to plan for long-term growth.

LONDON (Reuters) - British air accident investigators looking into the cause of the helicopter crash that killed Leicester City soccer club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha said on Wednesday they are focussing on a problem with the tail rotor system.

The helicopter’s manufacturer has issued a safety alert to all owners of the particular model AW169 involved in the crash, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said.

The manufacturer had been told to carry out a “precautionary inspection” of the system which controls the tail rotor.

"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced his resignation on Wednesday in protest at a Gaza ceasefire that he called a “capitulation to terror”, weakening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conservative coalition government.

“Were I to stay in office, I would not be able to look southern residents in the eye,” Lieberman told reporters, referring to Israelis subjected to a surge in Palestinian rocket attacks before Tuesday’s truce took hold.

Lieberman said his resignation, which will go into effect 48 hours after he submits a formal letter to Netanyahu, also withdraws his far-right Israel Beitenu party from the coalition.

Netanyahu will take over the defence portfolio himself, his party said. The loss of Israel Beitenu’s five seats will leave him with control of just 61 of the 120 seats in parliament, a year before Israel’s next election.

Political commentators had speculated that Netanyahu, who has high approval ratings despite being dogged by multiple corruption investigations, might bring forward the ballot.

They also saw in Lieberman’s decision to quit a bid to poach votes from Netanyahu and far-right cabinet rival Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home party, ahead of an election.

Netanyahu’s Likud played down the option of an early poll.

“There is no need to go to an election during what is a sensitive period for national security. This government can see out its days,” party spokesman Jonatan Urich said on Twitter.

CRACKS IN COALITION

The cracks in the coalition could soon widen, however.

In Jewish Home, which has eight lawmakers, there were calls for Bennett, now education minister, to succeed Lieberman as defence chief.

Bennett did not immediately comment. Were he to withdraw from the ruling coalition, a snap election would be inevitable. But as defence minister, he could be no less a thorn in Netanyahu’s side than Lieberman.

Lieberman and Bennett have spoken in favour of harsh Israeli military action against Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists, even as the government authorised a Qatari cash infusion to the impoverished enclave last week and limited itself to air strikes rather than a wider campaign during this week’s fighting.

Israel has fought three wars in Gaza since Hamas took over the enclave in 2007.

Violence persisted on lower scale on Wednesday, with Palestinians saying a Gaza fisherman was shot dead by Israeli forces. An Israeli military spokeswoman said the troops across the border identified a suspect approaching the Gaza fence and opened fire at him.

In a separate incident, the military said troops captured a Palestinian who tried to cut through the fence and threw grenades at them.

Netanyahu cast Israel’s handling of Gaza as prudence.

“Leadership also means standing up to criticism when you know things that are classified and which you cannot share with the public that you love,” he said in a speech. “Our enemies begged for a ceasefire, and they know well why.”

Hamas saw victory in the Lieberman’s departure. On Gaza City streets, Palestinian burned Lieberman’s photo and some motorists handed out candies to passersby in celebration.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday what mattered to him was the “excellent” cooperation between the U.S. and French armies, rather than tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump attacking him.

In five posts sent on Tuesday after his visit to France, Trump blasted the key U.S. ally over its near defeat to Germany in two world wars, its wine industry and Macron’s approval ratings.

"PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) has emerged as the probable buyer for 10 Airbus A330neo jets worth $3 billion, industry sources said, in a boost for the becalmed European model.

Airbus (AIR.PA) announced an order for 10 of the 300-seat aircraft in its latest monthly order update on Friday, but withheld the name of the buyer for the Oct. 30 deal.

Two industry sources, asking not to be named, said Delta (DAL.N) was the buyer. A third said Delta had been looking to expand an existing order for 25 A330neo aircraft.

Airbus declined comment. Delta was not immediately available for comment.

If confirmed, the deal would mark the second order for the slow-selling A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.

Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise after sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from the newer Boeing 787.

However, industry sources have questioned how far recent orders represent net new sales for the European giant, saying they could replace at least some earlier orders for the A350.

The new-generation A350 is a longer-term bet for Airbus and competes with the 787 and Boeing 777. But one market source said Airbus was willing to give up some orders for the newer plane in order to keep the A330neo afloat and prevent production cuts.

Airbus has given cautious signals that it is prepared to be flexible in both directions when offering combinations of the A330 and A350, sources said, though it cannot afford to lose too many orders or customers for the more strategic A350 plane.

The wide-body A330neo is part of a pair of upgraded aircraft - the other being the strong-selling A321neo narrowbody - that strategists say Airbus is trying to push into the market to reduce the space for a new 220-260 seat, mid-sized jet being studied by Boeing. A decision on that project is due next year.

Airbus is especially keen to continue A330-series production because it has been a major source of profits and cash.

Airbus also needs an aircraft like the 250-300 seat A330 to offer airlines a step-up into the wide-body market from its largest narrowbody, the A321neo, which holds up to 240 people.

Without it, Airbus’s smallest wide-body would be the 315-seat A350-900, which leaves a large gap in Airbus’s portfolio above the A321neo for rival Boeing (BA.N) to exploit.",Reuters,0

(Reuters) - Oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), majority owned by General Electric Co (GE.N), said a previously announced share offering was priced at a discount of 3.4 percent, sending shares of both companies lower on Wednesday.

The 92 million shares of Baker Hughes for sale by GE was priced at $23.00, below the stock’s $23.81 closing price on Tuesday, and came a day earlier than planned.

GE, which is struggling to rebuild its industrial businesses, said on Tuesday it would sell a portion of its stake in Baker Hughes to repay debt.

GE will be able to raise nearly $4 billion from the sale if underwriters exercise options to buy an additional 9.2 million shares, with Baker Hughes repurchasing another 65 million shares in a private transaction at a maximum aggregate of $1.5 billion.

The sale would bring down GE’s holdings in Baker Hughes to just north of a 50 percent stake, from 62.5 percent currently.

Shares of GE fell as much as 4.3 percent to $8.23, while Baker Hughes declined 5.3 percent to $22.55.

GE shares rallied as much as 13 percent before closing 7.8 percent higher in Tuesday’s session, while Baker Hughes gained more than 3 percent.",Reuters,0
"Brazilian carrier Azul is in ""very tough"" discussions with Airbus over when it will take its first A330-900, as customers face nearly year-long delays for the re-engined widebody.

""We're having very tough discussions with Airbus on when,"" Priscilla Branco, head of aircraft programmes at the Viracopos-based carrier, tells FlightGlobal at the ISTAT Latin America forum in Lima today.

Azul is scheduled to take its first three A330-900s next year, later than the initial late-2018 target, its latest fleet plan shows. However, Branco is not certain those deliveries will occur as planned, suggesting they may shift into 2020.

""Ask Airbus,"" she says on when next year the airline's first A330neo could arrive.

""It's up to our customers to reveal the delivery date,"" says Arturo Barreira, president for Latin America and the Caribbean at Airbus, in response to Azul's comments.

The first A330-900 delivery to TAP Portugal, the launch operator, was scheduled for the end of 2017 but has yet to occur. On 6 November, Airbus executives said the aircraft would be handed over in the ""coming days"", something TAP is still waiting on.

Hold ups with the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and flight-test programme have driven the delays.

The A330-900 only received its 180min extended twin-engine operations (ETOPS) approval, a necessary step for the aircraft to operate long-haul flights over water, on 9 November, says Branco.

Airbus, however, was not immediately able to confirm that the A330-900 had received ETOPS certification.

Azul and TAP are not the only carriers facing late A330neos. Delta Air Lines, which ordered 25 A330-900s in late 2014, has pushed its first deliveries back a year to 2020, its fleet plan from last December shows.

The Atlanta-based carrier's plan contradicts what A330neo chief engineer François Kubica told reporters earlier this month, when he said Delta would take ""their first aircraft in April next year"". Certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration is expected by year-end.

Delta declines to comment on the timing of its A330-900 deliveries.

Both Avolon, from which Azul is leasing its five A330neos, and Delta placed orders for the aircraft in 2014.

The A330neo is not the only Airbus programme facing delays. Deliveries of the European airframer's re-engined A320neo family have also been pushed back due to supply chain and engine issues.

The narrowbody programme delays are understood to be improving. Air Lease chief executive John Plueger, a frequent critic of the airframer's handling of the situation, said on 8 November that they ""feel confident that Airbus is getting a handle on their industrial situation"".

Airlines just want new aircraft on time. Branco, in comments echoed by executives from Copa Airlines, Chile's Sky Airline, and Volaris, says delays create a ""big challenge"" in planning for 2019.

Azul chief executive John Rodgerson echoes Branco's concerns in his own comments at ISTAT: ""We're very excited about pushing Mr [John] Slattery to get his aircraft done sooner so we don't run into the same problems we have with our friends in Toulouse.""

Slattery is president and chief executive of Embraer Commercial Aircraft, which is due to deliver its first E195-E2 to Azul in 2019, with the airline expecting up to eight of those aircraft during the year.

Azul operates seven A330-200s, and will have eight by the end of the year, its fleet plan shows. Prior to the delays, it was scheduled to add five A330-900s in 2019 and 2020.",Flight Global,0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several prominent investors raised their stakes in General Electric Co (GE.N) in the third quarter, before its shares sank in recent weeks, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on Wednesday.

D.E. Shaw & Co LP, Viking Global Investors LP and Canyon Capital Advisors LLC each reported larger holdings in GE in the quarter ended Sept. 30 than in the prior quarter, according to filing data collected by Refinitiv and reviewed by Reuters.

GE shares have collapsed more than 50 percent this year, including 31 percent over the last month. In October, GE posted a quarterly loss of $22.8 billion, cut its annual dividend to just 4 cents a share and told investors it was facing a deepening federal accounting probe. Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has promised to sell assets with “urgency” to reduce its high debt.

It is not clear whether the fund investors kept their stakes during the selloff. None of the funds responded to requests for comment.

Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings in 13F filings with the SEC are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying.

But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.",Reuters,0

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian airline SaudiGulf owner Al-Qahtani Aviation has signed an agreement to buy 10 Airbus (AIR.PA) A320neo family jets, Airbus said in a statement on Thursday.

The value of deal was not announced. It would be worth around $1.1 billion at list prices, though discounts are common.

BERLIN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department has delivered a report to Congress detailing implications of Turkey receiving 100 F-35 fighter jets, five people familiar with the report said, removing a key hurdle to concluding the deal.

Turkey’s planned purchase of the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system has raised concerns in the West, since it could be used to give Moscow deep insight into the vulnerabilities of the most advanced U.S. warplane at a time of tension between the two powers, experts have said.

Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s chief arms buyer, told Reuters in an interview that Turkey’s plans to buy the S-400 system were “extremely problematical” and numerous U.S. officials had discussed the issue with Ankara, but there were no signs that Turkey had changed its mind about buying the Russian system.

The United States has for years offered Turkey an alternative missile defense system - the Patriot missile defense system built by Raytheon Co and operated by other NATO allies. However, a sale has proven elusive amid cost and technology transfer issues.

Lord said the report to Congress “just lays out the facts of where we are,” rather than offering firm recommendations, but she declined to provide details.

“We need to work with Congress to decide where we go on that. There will be a strong partnership with Congress, and until we’ve discussed the issue with them...,” Lord told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a NATO industry conference in Berlin earlier this week.

Turkey last month said it was moving ahead with the controversial S-400 procurement and expected to begin installing the surface-to-air missile systems in October 2019.

The United States has repeatedly warned Turkey that going through with the purchase of S-400s could result in Washington imposing sanctions and halting other weapons deals, such as the F-35, but Ankara has pressed on with the Russian transaction.

Turkey is due to receive its third and fourth jets in March next year. Its pilots are receiving training on the first two aircraft at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The earliest the first aircraft could leave the United States is next summer, although it may take longer than that.",Reuters,0

CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Indonesia man, whose son was killed when a Lion Air flight crashed last month, has sued Boeing Co alleging that a defect in the design of the 737 MAX 8 aircraft caused it to crash.

The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, by the father of Dr. Rio Nanda Pratama, alleged that Boeing did not adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of an unsafe design condition. Boeing is headquartered in Illinois.

Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board.

Dr. Pratama, of Indonesia, was flying home from a conference when the plane crashed. He was to be married this week, according to attorney Curtis Miner of the Florida-based law firm Colson Hicks Eidson, which is representing his father in the wrongful death lawsuit.

Indonesian investigators are due to publish a preliminary report on the crash later this month.",Reuters,0
"Readers may recognise my name from the many flight tests I have written for Flight International over the years.

But it is with some trepidation that I venture to add my voice to the ongoing dialogue whirling around the tragic crash of Lion Air flight JT610.

I have flown the majority of 737 variants, from the -200, through the Classics, the Next Generation -800 and now the Max 8 as a captain for a US airline.

I offer the following observations only to spur a healthily discussion.

Firstly, it is worth stating that as transport aircraft have become more complex, somewhat perversely, the depth of systems knowledge expected of aircrew has diminished.

The 737’s Speed Trim System operates with the autopilot off to enhance flight characteristics in pitch at low-gross weights, high-thrust settings and aft centre of gravity. The STS will command stabiliser movement without pilot input. This system was detailed in manuals I received from two different airlines and taught in training classes. Proper operation of the STS would not be diagnosed by the crew as a runaway stabiliser.

But a new feature, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System was added to the Max to enhance pitch characteristics while the aircraft is being manually flown at a high angle of attack with the flaps up. MCAS is unique to the Max family: it commands stabiliser movement, without pilot input, to pitch the aircraft nose down. At my employer, at least, pilots were not made aware of the presence of this system. That discrepancy appears true at other US carriers as well.

On the Non-Normal Quick Reference Card for both the NG and Max aircraft, there is a checklist for use in the event of a runaway stabiliser. In the past, memorisation of the steps was required, but that is no longer requiraed; crews can instead reference the QRC when faced with the issue.

If the Lion Air crash was caused by a failure, or misapplication, of the MCAS, the crew may have been presented with characteristics similar to a runaway stabiliser. Execution of the relevant checklist may have stopped the undesired movement and may have allowed the crew to regain control of the aircraft.

Initial reports infer that erroneous angle-of-attack data may have caused the MCAS to kick in, repeatedly pushing the nose down.

That begs several questions: what is the level of redundancy (data parity checks) for the MCAS system? If reduced redundancy requirements were allowed by certificating authorities, was the existence of the established runaway elevator procedure a factor in the decision?

More crucially, perhaps, how and why was the existence of the MCAS hidden from operators and pilots?

Whether or not the crew’s ignorance of that system doomed the flight will be a conclusion I both eagerly await and dread with equal measure.",Flight Global,0
"GKN Aerospace's aftermarket support division Fokker Techniek has completed a base check on an Air Europa Airbus A330, marking the Dutch firm's first foray into widebody heavy maintenance.

Although Fokker upgraded the cabin of an A330 in 2017, the base check on the Air Europa twin-aisle was the company’s first “major” maintenance event on a widebody, GKN says. The aircraft was redelivered to the airline earlier this month.

GKN adds that all necessary training, tooling and equipment has been acquired to support A330s at its Woensdrecht MRO facility, and that further projects on the twinjet have been secured.

GKN plans to service additional long-haul types, including the A350 or Boeing 787.

Fokker Techniek managing director Jeff Armitage states: “By entering the widebody market, new opportunities will arise. This will include stepping into the world of modern composite aircraft in the years to come.”

The MRO site previously concentrated on support for 737s, A320-family jets and regional aircraft from Bombardier, Embraer and Fokker, with a particular focus on legacy equipment.

Noting that it is “paramount” for Air Europa that MRO providers meet deadlines for overhaul events, the carrier’s maintenance and engineering director, Alberto Linés, describes the A330 base check as a “great job with very good planning and controlled execution”.

"Embraer sees ""enormous"" opportunities to sell the E195-E2 across the Americas, as it prepares to deliver the first aircraft to Azul in less than a year.

""I think we're going to have enormous opportunities at the upper end of the family,"" said John Slattery, president and chief executive of Embraer Commercial Aircraft, at the ISTAT Latin America Forum in Lima on 15 November.

Opportunities include selling the roughly 120-seat narrowbody to US carriers looking for a small mainline narrowbody, and in Latin America to airlines seeking to upgauge from first generation E190s, he says.

Spirit Airlines and United Airlines are among those in the USA considering the E195-E2 among other options, while Aeromexico and Aerolineas Argentinas' regional subsidiary Austral Lineas Aereas are in the midst of campaigns to replace their E190s.

The E195-E2, launched at the Paris air show in 2013, includes a stretched fuselage, new Pratt & Whitney PW1900G geared turbofan engines, and a new wing.

Embraer is on track to certify the E195-E2 in the first half of 2019, and deliver the first aircraft to launch operator Azul early in the second half of the year, says Slattery.

Embraer's sales of E2s lag behind those of the Airbus A220, which received a boost with Airbus' purchase of the previously-named CSeries programme from Bombardier in July. JetBlue Airways, which had was in the midst of a campaign to replace its 60 E190s and a large Airbus A320 family operator, committed to the A220-300 shortly after the deal closed.

Philippe Balducchi, president of Airbus' partnership with Bombardier that owns the A220 programme, told FlightGlobal in July that the European airframer brought ""credibility"" and a ""certainty over the future"" that customers want before they invest in a new aircraft family.

The Airbus-Bombardier deal ""created a seismic shift shift in the competitive dynamic in the marketplace"", says Slattery. Embraer has responded with its own venture with Boeing that would see the Chicago-based airframer take an 80% stake in its commercial aircraft and services businesses.

""Being teamed up in some fashion with the balance sheet and a franchise footprint of somebody like Boeing, I think the customer base broadly sees that as a positive for the market,"" he says.

Embraer and Boeing are in the ""final furlong"", as Slattery puts it, of negotiations, after which the deal requires a number of approvals before it could close.

Asked whether Embraer expects a similar sales boost for the E2 when the transaction closes as the A220 saw, he says the airframer already has a ""good intimacy"" with the US network carriers, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. Each has bought numerous E175s for their regional fleets in recent years, Slattery adds.

EAGER CUSTOMER

Azul is eager to get the aircraft. The Viracopos, Brazil-based carrier anticipates a 14% reduction in trip costs from the shift to the E195-E2 with 136 seats from the E195 with 118 seats, said Priscilla Branco, head of aircraft programmes at Azul, in a presentation at the forum.

Azul plans to replace E190s and E195s on a one-for-one basis with the E2s as quickly as it can once deliveries begin, she says.

The airline operates nine E190s and 54 E195s, with firm orders for 36 E195-E2s, Flight Fleets Analyzer shows.

""We're very excited about pushing Mr Slattery to get his aircraft done sooner so we don't run into the same problems we have with our friends in Toulouse,"" said John Rodgerson, chief executive of Azul, referring to delays to its Airbus A320neo and A330-900 deliveries at the forum.

Slattery says Embraer is ""proud"" to deliver the first E195-E2 to Azul, which he calls the airframer's ""hometown airline"".

Viracopos is 170km from Embraer's Sao Jose dos Campos headquarters, Google Maps shows.

Embraer delivered the first E190-E2 to Wideroe in April, and plans to deliver aircraft to Air Astana and Fuzhou Airlines before year-end.

Azul, which has not finalised the number of E195-E2s it will take in 2019, has sale-and-leaseback financing in place for some if its first deliveries, says Branco. Lessors include AerCap, she adds.

Embraer has firm orders for 132 E-Jet-E2s, including 58 E190-E2s and 74 E195-E2s, Fleets Analyzer shows. It has options for another 52 aircraft and letters of intent for 510 aircraft.",Flight Global,0

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) is planning for a “no deal” Brexit as its “baseline” scenario amid a political storm over a draft transition deal, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters.

Europe’s largest aerospace group on Thursday welcomed a draft divorce agreement between London and Brussels, but said there needed to be more clarity to allow businesses to plan.

With Prime Minister Theresa May facing a battle to get her draft agreement on the terms of Britain’s departure from the European Union through parliament, and a potential revolt from members of her party, Airbus vowed to pursue contingency plans.

“The draft agreement is certainly encouraging but we must remember it is subject to parliamentary approvals,” the head of the company’s internal Brexit task force told staff.

“For the teams working on preparing for Brexit we must stay focused and keep working at full speed from a baseline of no deal.”

An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the memo but told Reuters, “the situation remains unclear, so we have to continue planning and putting in place mitigation measures,” adding this position was unchanged since a paper published in June.

The comments echo those of German carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE), which has said that with the politics so uncertain, it would continue to prepare for ‘no-deal’ or leaving the single EU market and customs union with no agreed transition.

Airbus, which employs 14,000 people in Britain and builds most wings for its jetliners there, said in June a ‘no-deal’ exit would cost it billions of euros and force it to reconsider its investments and “long-term footprint” in the country.

Chief Executive Tom Enders on Thursday called for “the removal of uncertainty as soon as possible”.",Reuters,0
"LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - UK business lined up to help Prime Minister Theresa May sell her draft Brexit agreement but continued to plan for Britain to crash out of the European Union without a deal as May fought for her political survival on Friday.

Europe’s largest aerospace group, Airbus (AIR.PA), is working on the assumption of a no-deal Brexit, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters. “For the teams working on preparing for Brexit we must stay focussed and keep working at full speed from a baseline of no deal,” it said.

Manufacturers like Rolls-Royce and Airbus fear that new customs duties and red tape that would kick in without a Brexit deal by March 29 would kill the just-in-time delivery of thousands of parts on which they depend.

May’s spokeswoman pointed to “strong support from the business community” as her office released statements from major companies including Diageo (DGE.L), the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) and Royal Mail (RMG.L).

But their influence appeared limited as members of parliament gathered signatures for a confidence vote that could trigger a leadership contest, following the resignation of key ministers in protest at the draft agreement.

Bookmaker William Hill (WMH.L) suspended betting on which year May would leave office and narrowed its odds on a second Brexit referendum to 6/4.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) and France’s Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA) will shortly submit an unsolicited proposal for initial conceptual work on a next-generation fighter jet to German and French officials, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The two companies agreed in principle in April to work together on an ambitious Franco-German programme to design a new warplane, but are anxious to get some early funding so they can start work on new technologies required for the multi-billion project - with a goal of fielding a new aircraft around 2040.

Germany and France signed a memorandum of understanding about the project in April, but progress has been halting amid disputes between the governments about future exports, and among industry about how to divvy up work on a system to integrate the new jet with drones and other weapons.

One source familiar with the matter said the two companies could submit their proposal by the end of the year or early next year, paving the way for the first contract awards next year.

One French military official told the International Fighter conference in Berlin this week that the two governments hoped to conclude an initial contract in January.

Peter Harster, senior executive with MTU Aero Engines (MTXGn.DE), said the study contract was needed, along with a medium-term budget plan, to help set a realistic timetable and key requirements to ensure the new jet would be ready by 2040.

Harster also called for a separate contract for work on an engine for the new jet to enable optimal flexibility and give the customers direct control over the propulsion system.

Bruno Fichefeux, head of future combat air systems at Airbus, told the conference he expected conceptual work on the programme to begin soon, “bilaterally or with Spain.”

A Spanish official told the conference his country was in discussions with both the Dassault-Airbus team, and a separate project being led by Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L) to secure a role on one of the projects. A French military official said the two projects could also be merged at a future date.

Douglas Barrie, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said government and industry ties would likely shift again, as in the 1970s and 1980s during work that ultimately led to the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault’s Rafale.

“We’re at the start of that process again now. And I don’t think it will take a decade to shake out, but it will take some time,” he said. “I think shifts are inevitable.”

"PARIS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said on Friday it ordered 10 Airbus (AIR.PA) A330neo long-haul jets, reinforcing its position as the first U.S. airline to operate the upgraded jet and lending its influential support to a slow-selling model.

The additional A330neo purchase is worth some $3 billion at list prices but is likely to represent below half that after typical discounts as the jet faces competition from newer models, market sources said.

As part of the order, Delta also confirmed it was deferring delivery of 10 pricier A350 jets to 2025-26. The agreement contains the right to convert the A350 orders to A330-900s.

Delta previously had 25 of each type of plane on order but said last year it was reviewing its wide-body requirements.

“Expanding our A330 order book not only ensures that Delta’s near-to-medium-term widebody needs are taken care of, but also drives our strategic, measured international growth,” Delta Chief Operating Officer Gil West said.

The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce’s (RR.L) new Trent 7000 engine, which offers fuel savings. But it has suffered delays as the British company focuses on fixing extensive problems on a similar model of engine that powers the Boeing (BA.N) 787.

With the new deal, Atlanta-based Delta’s A330neo order will grow to 35 from 25 jets. The airline also operates around 40 earlier A330 models that use a previous generation of engine.

For Airbus, it is the second order for the A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.

Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise. Sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from Boeing Co’s (BA.N) newer 787.

Industry sources say Airbus is prepared to use the power of its successful A350-900 order book to boost the A330neo by selectively allowing airlines to adjust existing orders for the newer and costlier A350 in favour of the A330neo.

Kuwait Airways has also struck a deal with Airbus allowing it to defer some A350 planes as it orders the A330neo, a person familiar with the matter said.

Delta currently operates 11 A350-900 aircraft and expects to take delivery of two planes in both 2019 and 2020. It will retire older Boeing 767s in coming years as they reach the end of their serviceable life cycle.",Reuters,0
"MONTREAL, TORONTO (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) top executives met with investors in Montreal on Friday after a disappointing free cash flow forecast and regulatory action, which sent the plane and train maker’s shares down 20 percent, sources familiar with the matter said.

REUTERS/Christinne Muschi

The Montreal meeting with Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare and Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert was previously scheduled but “the (high) participation and level of interest was driven by recent events,” said one of the two sources.

Bellemare had already met with investors following the free cash flow forecast on Nov. 8, which sent its shares down more than 23 percent on that day.

The Canadian company said it would only be able to meet its 2018 free cash flow estimate by using $635 million in proceeds from the sale of a Toronto plant earlier this year. Analysts had expected Montreal-based Bombardier to achieve its target of roughly breaking even on cash without relying on those proceeds.

Bellemare, credited with improving Bombardier’s finances after a crippling 2015 cash crunch, sought to reassure investors that the company would still achieve the company’s five-year turnaround plan designed to boost revenues and margins by 2020, said the source who could not provide further details on the meeting.

The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. A Bombardier spokesman declined to comment when asked about the meeting.

On Thursday, the province of Quebec’s securities watchdog asked Bombardier to halt stock trades under a plan set up to facilitate share sales by certain senior company executives.

The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) said it was “reviewing” transactions and “various announcements” related to Bombardier’s creation of an Automatic Securities Disposition Plan on Aug. 15.

Bombardier stock closed down 20 percent at C$1.67, adding to last week’s 31 percent slide.

The sell-off in the stock also spread to bonds. Bombardier has about C$12.3 billion ($9.35 billion) of bonds outstanding, much of which has been issued in U.S. dollars, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

The yield on Bombardier’s 7.5 percent U.S. dollar bond maturing in March 2025 has jumped by nearly 300 basis points over the last two weeks to 9.87 percent, its highest since July 2016.

"UTC Aerospace Systems is developing new ""fully-distributed"" electric flap and slat control systems for next-generation commercial aircraft such as Boeing's proposed New Mid-market Airplane (NMA).

The effort reflects UTAS' broader ""more electric"" initiative to develop electric aircraft systems to replace older hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical technologies, say UTAS executives.

The flap and slat systems envisioned by UTAS would use multiple electric motors distributed along the inside of the wing to extend or retract individual flaps and slats, UTAS actuation and propeller systems technical lead Paul Smith tells FlightGlobal.

The motors would be synchronised to move panels together as a system, though they could also move panels individually, providing new degrees of aircraft control, Smith says.

Led by UTAS' actuation systems business in the UK city of Wolverhampton, the technology would replace largely-mechanical systems currently installed on large commercial aircraft. Existing systems typically use central power units to turn transmission shafts that connect via gearboxes to the actuators that move flaps and slats, UTAS says.

""It probably lends itself more to the bigger aircraft in the shorter term – maybe something like an NMA, or a next-generation single-aisle"" aircraft, UTAS actuation systems business development director David Chard says of the technology.

The NMA is Boeing's envisioned New Mid-market Airplane, which would have some 220-270 seats and range up to 5,000nm (9,260km). The airframer intends to decide in 2019 whether to launch the project, with deliveries targeted to start by the middle of next decade, Boeing has said.

United Technologies chief executive Gregory Hayes has raised doubt if the company will compete for NMA work, citing Boeing's efforts to squeeze costs from suppliers.

""We would obviously like to have a position on that aircraft, but it has to make sense,"" Hayes said on 22 October. Boeing has ""some pretty tough cost targets out there, but they are optimistic about the market size"", he adds.

Working in partnership with other UK companies and universities, UTAS aims to finish developing the new slat and flap systems by 2022. The UK government has committed to fund half of the £6.5 million ($8.4 million) project, UTAS says.

Distributed electric flap and slat systems could use 40% fewer parts and weigh 10% less than existing systems, while also placing less load on aircraft structures, Smith says.

Workers could install the systems on new aircraft in about half the time as existing systems, enabling manufacturers to squeeze more efficiency out of production lines, he adds.

UTAS also intends to equip the systems with electric sensors to warn airlines of potential flap or slat failures.

UTAS already produces flap or slat components on aircraft like Airbus A220s, A320s, A330s, Bombardier CRJs and Irkut MC-21s, the company says.",Flight Global,1
"Virgin Orbit’s modified Boeing 747-400 completed its first test flight on 19 November carrying the 21.4m (70ft) -long “LauncherOne” rocket attached to its port wing.

The test by Richard Branson’s small-satellite launch company was designed to prove the feasibility of using the ex-Virgin Atlantic 747 N744VG (ex- G-VWOW) to launch the two-stage rocket. The system uses the existing “fifth-pod” engine-pylon attachment points on the underside of the wing.

The 1h 20min test flight from Victorville, California moves Virgin Orbit a step closer in its plan to reach orbit in early 2019, says chief executive Dan Hart. “[This is] a major step forward in our quest to bring a new capability to small satellite launch,” he adds.

The flight was used to assess the 747’s take-off, landing, and low-speed handling and performance of the integrated system.

“The vehicles flew like a dream,” says Virgin Orbit Chief Pilot Kelly Latimer. “Everyone on the flight crew and all of our colleagues on the ground were extremely happy with the data we saw from the instruments on-board the aircraft, in the pylon, and on the rocket itself.”

This marks the start of a new phase in Virgin Orbit’s 747 flight-test campaign, which will involve several more sorties - some with and some without a LauncherOne rocket attached.

Further trials will conclude with a drop-test, during which a rocket will be released without igniting. Virgin Orbit expects its first space shot will be undertaken early next year.",Flight Global,0
"Bombardier's commercial aviation business faces a ""challenging time"" after its divestiture of two of its three commercial aircraft divisions, says Embraer Commercial Aviation chief executive John Slattery.

The Montreal-based airframer finalised a deal to sell the Dash 8 programme to Longview Aviation Capital, an affiliate of Viking Air, for $300 million earlier in November, and closed the sale of a majority stake in its CSeries – now A220 – programme to Airbus in July. This leaves just the venerable CRJ programme in its commercial aviation portfolio.

""Now you're left with [the] CRJs of which, I think, they probably have about 50 aircraft in the backlog,"" said Slattery at the ISTAT Latin America Forum in Lima on 15 November. ""It's difficult to have a real performing sales, marketing and support organisation, along with sustainable engineering to support a dwindling backlog.""

A dwindling backlog, he adds, means fewer pre-delivery deposits (PDPs) that are the ""life blood"" of an OEM, providing funds to continue business.

""It's clearly a challenging time in Mirabel right now,"" says Slattery.

Bombardier, for its part, has made no pretence of remaining in the commercial aircraft business.

""Bombardier is well positioned with our rail, business aircraft and aero-structures business,"" the airframer's chief executive Alain Bellemare told analysts and investors earlier in November. ""In the future, this will be where we will deploy our capital to [ensure] strong return on investment.""

The CRJ programme, he said, was a money loser for Bombardier and, while they continue to participate in the regional aircraft market, they were ""exploring strategic options"".

Even if the airframer sells the CRJ programme, 1,412 aircraft remain in service around the world, Fleets Analyzer shows.

"(Reuters) - Colfax Corp (CFX.N) made a big bet on the medical device industry with its $3.15 billion purchase of DJO Global Inc, but its shares fell 15.2 percent as investors worried about its shift away from its industrial roots to a completely new sector.

Colfax said it is exploring strategic options, including a sale, for its air and gas handling business, which makes compressors and turbines largely for oil and gas companies.

The DJO deal, the company’s biggest ever, moves it to a fast-growing industry familiar to its founders and chief executive officer. Brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales, who founded Colfax two decades ago, also built medical equipment company Danaher Corp (DHR.N), while CEO Matt Trerotola worked at Danaher before joining Colfax.

But the acquisition and plans to offload the air and gas unnerved investors and analysts.

“It’s a completely new market for the firm, outside of the industrial market. Also, the strategic review of the non-welding business was unexpected,” Northcoast Research analyst Tom Hayes said.

The company is buying DJO Global from Blackstone Group (BX.N), hoping to tap the growing demand for medical devices such as knee and hip implants from aging baby boomers.

“DJO strengthens our exposure to higher-growth, higher-margin, less cyclical markets,” Trerotola said on a call with analysts.

The air and gas handling business, which makes heat exchangers and gas compressors, generated about 40 percent of Colfax’s total revenue in 2017.

The core of the air handling business is tied to global energy projects, Hayes said. “These tend to be large in nature and thus are cyclical and can also be deferred or delayed, which makes the revenue from these projects more unreliable.”

The DJO deal will add to Colfax’s adjusted profit in the first full year after the deal closes in the first quarter of 2019. DJO will operate as a new segment within Colfax after the deal.

Colfax will fund the deal with cash, debt and equity.

"Investigations into the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max ­tragedy last month are examining any role that a new automated stability system may have played.

The Max is the first 737 to be equipped with the Maneuvring Characteristics Augmentation System. This is a form of “flight-envelope protection” that automatically counters certain handling “characteristics” caused by design changes on the 737 Max. Specifically, this is a pitch-up in certain configurations as a result of the more powerful and repositioned engines.

Crucially, the existence of the new Max system and its functions had apparently not been included in the conversion syllabus for pilots, many of whom fly the new variant alongside earlier 737s.

Back in the 1960s, an automatic pitch-control system was introduced to counter a flying characteristic caused by a design attribute. These were the “stick-pusher”, deep stall and T-tail configuration, respectively. Like MCAS, the stick-pusher triggers in manual flight. And like the MCAS, it could malfunction. But unlike MCAS – until now – crews were well aware of its existence and trained to deal with malfunctions.

"There are few signs to or on Tecnam's modern production plant just outside the small town of Capua, near Naples. However, the cult Italian manufacturer – which has produced almost 5,000 small piston aircraft for the training and private pilot market since the late Professor Luigi Pascale founded it in 1986 – is about to be very much on the map in the wider commercial aviation world.

This is thanks to its latest, and largest, design, the 11-seat, Lycoming TEO-540-powered P2012 twin. Tecnam believes that – as the first aircraft to be certificated in this segment for decades – the Traveller can replace many of the thousands of ageing legacy piston types serving island and other remote communities from Scotland to the South Pacific, including the Cessna 402 and Britten-Norman Islander.

Tecnam, which has roots going back to Pascale's first ventures in aviation 70 years ago, launched the P2012 in 2011 (all Tecnam's aircraft are named after the year work on the programme begins) and five examples are now in production at Capua – with two in flight test. Planned first delivery to Massachusetts-based Cape Air is early next year. The employee-owned carrier, which has ordered 100, helped Tecnam design the aircraft from scratch.

In fact, Cape Air founder and chief executive Dan Wolf has literally made his mark on the type. His signature adorns the forward bulkhead of the first production aircraft, 003, which was close to completion when FlightGlobal visited the facility in early October. Two others were in advanced stages of assembly, while the two flight-test prototypes were busy in the final stages of the certification campaign.

SIMPLE DESIGN

Cape Air – which flies routes to the Caribbean and small communities and vacation resorts in New England – is actually an operator of one of the types Tecnam thinks the Traveller can supersede, with 83 Cessna 402s in its fleet. After being rebuffed by Cessna and Piper, the carrier turned to the Italian company around 2009 to ask it to come up with an all-new passenger aircraft around its specific needs.

These included a requirement for single-pilot operation, a modern, but unpressurised cockpit and cabin, a high wing for better passenger visibility and rough runways, fixed landing gear, a metal structure, and removable panels to give mechanics easy underfloor access. ""It’s all about simplicity, for flying and for maintenance"" says Walter da Costa, Tecnam’s global sales and marketing director.

With the Lycoming engines delivering 375hp (280kW), the P2012 has a maximum cruise speed of 190kt (351km/h) and maximum take-off weight of 3,600kg (7,930lb). A large passenger door, twin cockpit doors, a spacious cabin, and a range of 950nm (1,750km) means the type is suitable for a wide range of missions, from commuter and charter air taxi to medevac, troop transport and cargo, suggests da Costa.

At its newly extended Capua facility, Tecnam is getting ready for a rapid production ramp-up, with plans to build around 15 Travellers in 2019, of which eight to 10 will be for Cape Air. On top of the US airline's 100 commitments, da Costa says there are about 30 additional orders ""from around the world"", although Seychelles charter company Zil Air – taking two P2012s – is the only other named customer.

Production will increase to 25 in 2020 and then 35 the following year, says da Costa. Although the current plant could cope with annual volumes of 40 aircraft, Tecnam is looking to extend the premises further or open a second site, especially if there is a flurry of new orders. The company's semi-rural location next to Capua's little-used airfield means there are plenty of options.

Of the two flight-test examples, aircraft 002 has a 90% production-conforming cockpit, and by early October had contributed about 200 of the total 500 flying hours carried out by the pair. The chance to design a ""clean"" cockpit meant Tecnam could introduce features not available in legacy competitors, with their rather cluttered control panels.

For instance, the flight management system is easily accessible, directly below the Garmin G1000 NXi glass cockpit, rather than between the pilot seats. Passenger comfort enhancements in the certificated aircraft might include an optional air conditioning system. Operators can also quickly remove seats to make space for additional cargo, or a stretcher, says da Costa.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

Although, in cabin size, the Traveller directly rivals the Cessna 402 and Islander, Tecnam concedes it will also compete with modern aircraft such as the single-engined Quest Kodiak and Viking Twin Otter. However, the Twin Otter in particular is larger, heavier and more expensive – and the P2012 will give operators a chance to ""right size"" on routes where nine seats or fewer are required, says da Costa.

In terms of aftersales support, Tecnam will shortly announce a contract with a ""global parts supply company"" and is in talks with several companies about designing a simulator. Cape Air will initially keep its aircraft close to its Hyannis headquarters, operating local routes, and using two pilots – though not required by the Federal Aviation Administration – to build experience.

The airline will have ""someone on site for the first year from Tecnam"", Cape Air president Linda Markham told FlightGlobal at September's Regional Airline Association conference in the USA. ""As we get more airplanes, we will start to diversify and put them in more regions,"" she added.

While the Traveller is Tecnam's most complex and important programme, the company is also focusing on the rest of its range, which comprises the P2008 and P2002 two-seat, piston-single trainers, as well as the Lycoming IO 360-powered P2010 four-seat single, a type pitched largely at the enthusiast market.

In additional, there is the Rotax-powered P2006T twin, which has retractable landing gear and is used chiefly for more complex, multi-engine pilot training. Tecnam built around 200 aircraft last year, and expects roughly the same output in 2018, with the P2006 and P2008 remaining the top sellers.

Tecnam distributes through 65 dealers around the world, with subsidiaries in Australia and the USA. Four years ago, the company signed an agreement with China's Liaoning United Aviation Shenyan (LUSY) to reassemble three models for the local pilot training school market – the P2006, P2008, and P2010. Eventually, the plan is for the Chinese to move to full-scale assembly.

During November's Zhuhai air show, Tecnam and LUSY announced an order from Anhui Lantian International Flight Academy, or ALIFA, for 30 P2006s and P2010s. Intended to replace a ""legacy fleet"" of training aircraft, ALIFA says the Tecnam types will help fulfil its ambition to be a ""world-class flight training organisation"".

Pascale – a legend in the Italian general aviation industry – died in March last year, aged 93. He and his brother Giovanni built their first aircraft in 1951 – a giant photograph of the pair with their design adorns the entrance area at Capua. Although Tecnam is now headed by their nephew, Paolo Pascale, the elder Pascale was still involved to the end, helping to conceive the P2012.

In the late 1950s, Luigi Pascale went on to found Partenavia, which in the early 1970s produced the P68 light twin, a six-seat passenger and utility aircraft that inspired the P2012. Although four decades separate the two designs (a separate company, Vulcanair, now owns the rights to the original aircraft), there is a clear evolution from one to the other.

As Tecnam now prepares to enter the passenger transport market for the first time in its own right, da Costa believes many carriers will really be taking notice. ""It's the first time we've developed an aircraft from the operator's point of view,"" he says. ""There is a lot of interest around the world to see what Cape Air do with it.""",Flight Global,0
"Once upon a time, in the not so distant past, ­Bombardier was the third-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft in the world, behind the industry’s big two of Airbus and Boeing.

But with the departure of the CSeries in July, and now the sale of the Q400 turboprop airliner, those heady days seem but a distant memory.

The Canadian airframer’s aerospace operation – so painstakingly assembled through acquisition – is looking increasingly sparse.

Aside from its business aviation division – comprising the relatively robust Challenger and Global families, as well as the floundering Learjet – Bombardier Aerospace is now built on the CRJ regional jet and its aerostructures unit.

However, the noises coming out of Bombardier’s Montreal HQ seem to indicate that the CRJ line will eventually be divested as well.

Bombardier seems increasingly like the Black Knight in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail who, as each limb is hacked away, pronounces that “’tis but a scratch”.

This slow dismemberment has many causes, not least of which were the crippling debts acquired during the development of the CSeries – now the Airbus A220.

There was other, unseen, damage caused by the costly gestation: engineering and management resources were sunk into the programme to the detriment of the CRJ and Q400, as Bombardier has belatedly acknowledged.

And while Bombardier was busy fixing the CSeries, competitors ATR and Embraer were equally busy ­winning the battle for regional aircraft sales.

For instance, in the USA alone, Embraer suggests it has taken a share of over 85% in the market for 75-seat aircraft. ATR, meanwhile, has inflicted similar damage in the turboprop segment. Unfortunately for Bombardier, it has found those injuries difficult to recover from.

What, then, for the remaining rump of Bombardier Aerospace? Providing the remaining problems with the business jet division – chiefly Learjet – can be resolved, then the operation looks more stable – healthy, even.

The outlook for the aerostructures operation is harder to divine, however. Does it have enough in-house work, or are more third-party contracts required? Or, perish the thought, is a new owner needed for long-term stability?

SEOUL (Reuters) - Jeju Air Co Ltd (089590.KS), South Korea’s biggest low-cost carrier, purchased 40 Boeing (BA.N) 737 Max 8 planes worth $4.4 billion, the airline said on Tuesday.

The deal marks the biggest contract by a South Korean carrier in numbers of a single aircraft type model, the company said.

Reuters exclusively reported earlier this month that Jeju Air was in talks with Boeing and Airbus (AIR.PA) to buy 50 jets as the airline planned to expand its network that includes one of the world’s busiest routes.

The purchase contract includes an option to buy an additional 10 aircraft, Jeju Air said.

The airline operator said it planned to take delivery of the planes between 2022 and 2026.

Six South Korean budget carriers saw the number of passengers using international routes quadruple to 20.3 million in 2017 from 4.9 million in 2013, according to South Korea’s transport ministry.

“The order of Boeing 737 Max planes will help the company maintain its cost competitiveness, fuelling us to grow as a leading carrier,” Jeju Air said.

The company currently operates 58 routes with 38 Boeing 737-700 planes.",Reuters,0
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) plans to hold a conference call with airlines on Tuesday morning to discuss systems on the 737 MAX model that crashed in Indonesia last month, according to four sources with familiar with the matter.

A Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX crashed in the Java Sea on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board, in the first major accident involving the latest version of its popular narrow-body plane.

After the crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines that erroneous inputs from the anti-stall system’s sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control.

American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) last week said it had been “unaware” of some functions of the so-called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) designed to prevent the 737 MAX from stalling.

Indonesian investigators said the system was not detailed in Lion Air’s flight manual.

Bloomberg first reported on Boeing’s plans to hold a call with airlines on Tuesday. One of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the call might be postponed.

Boeing last week said it had provided two updates for operators around the world that re-emphasise existing procedures to deal with situations relating to MCAS. Boeing declined to provide further comment.

In a message to employees on Monday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said news reports that claimed the manufacturer withheld information on MCAS from airlines were “untrue” and the function had been described in the flight crew operations manual, according to aviation journalist Jon Ostrower.

In a memo on Friday, a United Airlines (UAL.O) union said the carrier’s pilots were properly trained to handle an MCAS malfunction even though the system was not mentioned in a course for those switching from older models to the new jet.

A preliminary report on the Lion Air crash will be released on Nov. 28 or 29, according to Indonesian investigators who have analysed the doomed jet’s flight data recorder.

However, divers have yet to locate the airline’s cockpit voice recorder, which would shed light on pilot interactions that are important for gaining a fuller picture of the circumstances of the crash.",Reuters,0

"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Loss-making South African arms maker Denel has a problem as it fights to survive. Its potential saviour is Saudi Arabia, now drawing fierce criticism following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

But after being mismanaged for years and tainted by a far-reaching influence-peddling scandal, state-owned Denel now needs the kind of help that the deep-pocketed Saudis can provide.

Reuters analysed five years of South African arms export data, spoke to former and current Denel employees and obtained internal Denel presentations on plans to rescue the company.

What emerged is that Saudi Arabia and its allies account for almost half of South Africa’s recent arms exports and a significant portion of future orders.

So rejecting Riyadh’s $1 billion offer could severely hamper efforts to save Denel, which relies on foreign sales for more than 60 percent of its revenue.

Saudi Arabia is seeking a broad partnership with Denel that would include acquisition of the company’s minority stake in a joint venture with Germany’s Rheinmetall.

The Saudis - on a drive to build a domestic arms industry as traditional suppliers worry about its human rights record - are keen to close the deal by the end of next month. A source with knowledge of its offer said the kingdom could take its business elsewhere if that does not happen.

Some Denel employees are also keen on a tie-up, seeing it as the only way to rescue the firm, which is struggling to pay salaries. But some South African officials are concerned about doing business with Saudi Arabia.

“Denel depends on the deal. The entire industry depends on the deal,” said Helmoed Heitman, a defence analyst. “I think it’s 50/50. The pragmatists want to go in, but the Khashoggi thing is bad PR.”

With President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ruling African National Congress facing an election next year, the deal promises to become a political issue.

South Africa’s main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, says the Saudi offer should be rejected.

“Putting our state defence firm at the disposal of a murderous despot would make the whole nation complicit in the human rights atrocities of the regime of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,” said DA lawmaker Stevens Mokgalapa.

“That there are negotiations to consider this at all is an indictment of the approach of the Ramaphosa government to international human rights violations.”

Saudi Arabia denies that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s killing.

APARTHEID INDUSTRY

Denel owes its existence to South Africa’s own dark past.

Its direct forebear, Armscor, was forced to produce nearly all of its own defence and security hardware in response to sanctions on the apartheid government.

It’s that expertise that is now so attractive to Saudi Arabia as it seeks to build its own industry, Andreas Schwer, head of the Saudi state defence company, SAMI, told Reuters.

“South Africa is very integrated in their capabilities because they had to become quite independent,” he said last month. “We believe South Africa can offer us more than just products. They can help us on this journey.”

Denel - formed in 1992 - only started to turn a regular profit from 2011 after being restructured several times. But its financial position remained weak as it used profits from some divisions to subsidise others.

In 2016 senior management became embroiled in a corruption scandal involving friends of former president Jacob Zuma, the Gupta brothers. In response, banks pulled lending. The company recorded a 1.7 billion rand ($122 million) loss - its first in eight years - in the financial year that ended in March.

Denel’s new management is working on a turnaround plan to secure new funding and exit some loss-making business units, like satellite development and its Pretoria Metal Pressings foundry, a presentation seen by Reuters showed.

It also wants to cut its salary bill by 20 percent and achieve cost savings of between 157 million and 608 million rand in each of the next five years, the presentation showed.

But it missed out on additional state funds in last month’s budget, and labour unions reject wage cuts. A cash crunch has become so dire that the company cannot provide toilet paper to some employees, and production lines sometimes stand idle as payments to suppliers fall behind.

Members of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which represents a quarter of Denel’s 4,000-strong workforce, marched to the public enterprises ministry this month to demand a 7 billion rand ($500 million) bailout.

Insiders say even that would be little more than a stopgap.

“The machine has stopped,” a former Denel executive told Reuters. “I can’t see how Denel can pull itself up by its bootstraps without an equity partner.”

‘OUR COMMON RELIGION’

Ramaphosa appeared open to bringing in a partner to bolster Denel when he acknowledged the Saudi bid earlier this month.

Foreign Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said any deliberations over a potential deal would be based on South Africa’s values.

“Our common religion is human rights. We have suffered too long to ever veer away from that religious belief,” she told journalists last month.

But Khashoggi’s death has created a dilemma.

Asked about the killing, Ramaphosa told reporters: “We are hoping that they will deal with the matter speedily so that the truth will come out.”

The United States has announced sanctions against those believed to have been directly involved. Germany is halting arms exports to Saudi Arabia until it explains the killing.

It’s the kind of backlash that Riyadh - under fire since 2015 over its war against in Yemen - has long feared and it explains why the government is building its own arms industry. It’s also why it has turned to South Africa.

“South Africa’s export policy was always stable and robust ... and we need very reliable partners on the political side, on the export policy side. Partners who do not change their minds,” SAMI CEO Schwer said before Khashoggi’s murder.

In 2013, South African sales to coalition allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates made up around 9 percent of total arms exports, a Reuters analysis of data shows.

Since the Yemen war began, South Africa has sold the two countries military hardware - armoured vehicles, sniper rifles, bombs, mortars and surveillance equipment - worth 4.6 billion rand, or 44 percent of total arms exports.

But what might have appeared a natural arrangement to save Denel now appears fraught.

Despite apparent government enthusiasm to do business with Saudi Arabia and Denel’s pressing need for financial rescue, not everyone is open to the kingdom’s overtures.

Responding to Reuters publication of details of the Saudi bid, Denel chairperson Monhla Hlahla rejected out of hand a sell-off of Denel’s stake in Rheinmetall Denel Munition.

“The board of Denel is selling neither Denel, or RDM. I want to be clear about that,” she told a local television network.

News of the Saudi overtures has also provoked an outcry on South African social media, but a senior ANC source said the government would not be rushed into a decision.

“It’s a strategic asset, so I would be wary about dealing with any foreign country, be that the Saudis or anyone else,” the source said.

But despite Ramaphosa’s assertion that Saudi Arabia was only one of several suitors, no others have come forward publicly.

“A billion dollars over two or three years would turn around Denel,” said Heitman, the defence analyst. “The longer we wait, the less Denel is worth. People will leave and that’s where the value lies.”",Reuters,0
"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is poised to make top financial and operational appointments as incoming CEO Guillaume Faury tightens his grip after months of turmoil over corruption investigations and output delays, sources familiar with the matter said.

The European planemaker could announce a new German chief financial officer as early as Wednesday to take over from Harald Wilhelm, who announced in May that he would leave next spring at the same time as current chief executive Tom Enders.

It could also name a new operations boss to succeed Tom Williams, the chief operating officer of the main Airbus planemaking business, the sources said.

Airbus declined comment.

Williams, a Glasgow-born veteran troubleshooter and Airbus’s unofficial UK ambassador, had agreed to postpone retirement until the end of the year to help tackle production delays but is likely to be succeeded by a German appointee in what could be seen as a blow to the profile of the company’s UK arm ahead of Brexit.

Programs chief Didier Evrard also delayed his retirement until the end of the year.

Reuters reported last month that Airbus was close to naming a German executive from outside the group to replace fellow German Wilhelm after a board-driven management overhaul hastened his surprise resignation.

British and French authorities are investigating the use of middlemen in jetliner sales and Airbus says it is supplying information to U.S. authorities.

Wilhelm has not been accused of wrongdoing and it was he who initiated the planemaker’s decision in 2014 to halt a decades-old system of middlemen supporting jet sales.

But sources have said that his departure reflects a clearout designed to help Airbus to win more lenient judicial settlements by presenting a fresh face to investigators. A number of operational appointments, meanwhile, is expected to underscore Faury’s focus on stabilizing output and fixing quality problems.

"PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France and Germany have reached an agreement on the next steps in a joint programme to design a next-generation combat jet, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said on Tuesday.

The jet, due to go into service in 2040, is expected to replace the Rafale, built by France’s Dassault Aviation, and Germany’s Eurofighters, made by a European consortium.

Parly said on Twitter that the agreement included the planned launch of a prototype or demonstrator of both the aircraft and the engine by the middle of next year.

“Decisive step today with the agreement to start the architecture and design studies and the launch of demonstrators (aircraft and engine) by mid-2019,” Parly tweeted. “It is advancing.”

Germany and France signed a memorandum of understanding in April and agreed that France would take the lead. The two governments have been at odds about future exports, while the companies involved are fighting over leadership of the system to integrate the jet with drones and other weapons.

Dassault and Airbus will shortly submit an unsolicited proposal for initial conceptual work on the new fighter jet to German and French officials, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.

The two companies agreed in principle in April to work together on the programme, but say they need early funding so they can start work on new technologies required.

France’s Safran and Germany’s MTU Aero Engines are expected to join forces to develop the engine. French electronics firm Thales and European missile maker MBDA are also seeking a stake.

Safran is expected to take the lead in the development of the engines with MTU as the subcontractor, French business newspaper La Tribune reported on its website on Tuesday.

A French military official told the International Fighter conference in Berlin last week that the two governments hoped to conclude an initial contract in January.

Bruno Fichefeux, head of future combat air systems at Airbus, told the conference he expected conceptual work on the programme to begin soon, “bilaterally or with Spain.”

Germany, France and Spain have completed separate studies on the next generation fighter.

La Tribune said Spain, which had been in discussions with a rival project launched by Britain in July, will join the Franco-German programme once it is stabilised and will sign a letter on intent to do so in the first quarter of next year.

"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada’s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) is the front-runner to win a New Jersey Transit (NJT) rail car contract, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a boost for the plane-and-train-maker’s North American business which has wrestled with delivery delays and has lost orders to rivals.

The order for up to 999 multilevel passenger cars, including options, would be one of the largest contracts in years if most of the options are exercised, one of the sources said.

Chinese state rail company CRRC Corp (601766.SS) was also vying for the contract. NJT ruled out the competing bid from the Chinese company, the sources said, although it was not immediately clear why.

CRRC and NJT did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bombardier Transportation spokesman Eric Prud’Homme declined by email to comment on what he called an “ongoing procurement.” He said the volume of the contract is 999 multilevel cars, but he said the “agency has not awarded the contract yet.”

Reuters reported in April that Bombardier was vying for the contract from NJT, which planned to order 113 multilevel passenger cars, with hundreds more in options, to modernize its aging fleet.

NJT, the largest statewide public transportation system in the United States, with over 900,000 daily riders, has been criticized by commuters and public officials for delays and breakdowns. An audit published in October concluded that its operations were “inefficient” and “unsustainable.”

Bombardier, which counts NJT as a longstanding customer, has since been selected as the preferred bidder for the order, whose value is not clear because it depends on the number of options exercised by the agency.

One of the sources said Bombardier had an advantage because of its previous work on rail cars for New Jersey.

Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity about privately-held talks for the contract. One said the order could be finalized as early as December, although such decisions can always be delayed.

Earlier this year, Kawasaki (7012.T) of Japan won a New York metro car contract worth up to $3.7 billion, including options.

Bombardier was taken out of the running for the New York deal because of delays on a previous order.

Investors are closely watching Bombardier’s Berlin-based transportation unit after the company attributed a disappointing free cash flow forecast to working capital needs in the division, sparking a sell off of its stocks and bonds.

Bombardier shares were roughly flat in Toronto trading on Tuesday, after surging on Monday when analysts described a separate regulatory investigation into the company’s executive share sales plan as routine.

Montreal-based Bombardier partly attributed the cash issue to a half dozen rail contracts, including one in Switzerland, where cars are being delivered later than expected. These deliveries, when trainmakers are paid, are now expected mainly in 2019, instead of 2018.

“The cash receipt is not lost, it’s just moved in time, mainly into 2019,” spokesman Prud’Homme said in an email.

The company has faced difficulties with late deliveries in the past to Metrolinx, the provincial agency which manages public transportation in Greater Toronto, Canada’s largest city.

"Bombardier plans to cut 490 jobs at its UK aerostructures operation in Belfast as part of wider efforts to restructure the Canadian manufacturer’s aerospace activities.

The airframer says that it “reviewed manpower requirements in Belfast” and decided that it needs to “continue to cut costs and improve the efficiency of our operations to help ensure our long-term competitiveness”.

Just under 4,000 staff are employed at Bombardier’s Belfast facilities, which produce CRJ centre fuselages, wing components for the Q400 turboprop, and fuselage sections and other components for the manufacturer’s business jet programmes.

The Belfast site also manufactures wings for the A220, previously known as the CSeries, which was transferred to Airbus control in July.

Earlier this month, Bombardier disclosed that it was disposing of ""non-core assets"" - including selling the Q400/Dash 8 programme and its business aircraft training unit - and embarking on a widespread restructuring, in which it would shed 5,000 jobs across the whole company over the next 18 months.

Some 3,000 of those redundancies are to be made in Canada and also include posts in the rail business.

(Reuters) - U.S. space agency NASA said on Tuesday it would review the workplace safety culture at SpaceX and Boeing Co, as the two companies gear up to fly astronauts to the International Space Station.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it would conduct a “cultural assessment study” of the companies, “including the adherence to a drug-free environment,” prior to crew test flights scheduled to take place in the coming months.

“We fully expect our commercial partners to meet all workplace safety requirements in the execution of our missions,” said NASA in a statement.

The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000-powered aircraft has been cleared for 180min ETOPS by the European Aviation Safety Agency.

But EASA says the clearance is restricted to powerplants with a life of less than 500 engine flight cycles.

The limitation is confirmed in a 9 November amendment to EASA certification documentation for the Trent 7000, which is a derivative of the Trent 1000 for the Boeing 787.

“It is expected that these restrictions will be removed at a later issue of [the certification document],” it adds.

"Even during a late afternoon visit, Avio Aero's factory in Pomigliano d'Arco, near Naples, is abuzz. It is not only because the Italian propulsion systems manufacturer is engaged in the fastest engine ramp-up in peacetime – the plant makes low-pressure turbine vanes and the combustor for the CFM International Leap engine that powers all Boeing 737 Max aircraft and is one of two options for the Airbus A320neo. Avio Aero is also five years into what chief executive Riccardo Procacci describes as a ""transformation"" under owner GE Aviation. That process involves overhauling each of its sites with new equipment, but also in the way employees are organised and think about their job.

At the plant, where Avio Aero is also, in another dedicated hall, gearing up for volume production of the low-pressure turbine for the Boeing 777X's GE9X, traditional process- or functional-based departments have largely been scrapped. Instead, shop floor staff work in self-contained, colour-coded zones, focusing on one product.

As he leads us around decades-old buildings packed with new machinery, Marco Rossi, Avio Aero's lean leader at the Pomigliano plant, explains that the idea is to have as many functions as possible in one cell. This in turn reduces the time wasted every time a component – or a worker – has to move from one area of the factory to another.

DRIVING ACCOUNTABILITY

Everywhere charts detail not just production numbers and targets, but how many kilometres of transporting parts around the shop floor the company has saved by rearranging an area in a certain way, which he says is very much the ""GE way"".

If this means employees are getting less exercise by walking than they used to, Avio Aero is certainly becoming leaner as a result, he says. The cell-based approach also encourages a ""sense of ownership"" among each team member. ""It’s about bringing accountability, visibility, responsibility down to machine level, rather than something that only concerns the executive office,"" he says.

Neither is working in self-contained cells within the factory something that encourages employees to adopt an insular outlook, Rossi insists. While the notice boards record how teams are performing relative to others, staff are encouraged to look at what colleagues in other groups are achieving, and to share and learn from best practice. This is something that Avio Aero management are also encouraged to do between factories. As Rossi notes: ""It’s about democratising data. Each team knows how they are performing. You cannot improve what you don't measure.""

According to Procacci, who is based at Avio Aero's headquarters and largest factory near Turin – there are others in Brindisi, on the Adriatic coast, and in Poland – the company's physical and cultural change is ""in full swing, but we are not done by any means"". Four of the five years since GE's acquisition of the Italian firm were spent ""establishing the basis for us to win the right to get to the new phase of transformation"", he says. Now, he says, the company is undergoing a lean manufacturing revolution that is ""really about how we activate and engage our 4,800 people, not just the managers"".

Just over half of Avio Aero's revenues come from work carried out for its internal customer or its CFM International partner Safran. The Leap and the GE9X, which is due to fly on the 777-9 next year, as well as the new general aviation Catalyst engine, are the key emerging programmes.

""These are the ones that are ramping up or getting ready for ramp-up and will define the company for the next 20 to 30 years,"" says Procacci. In addition, legacy products such as the CFM International CFM56, as well as the GE Aviation GE90 and GEnx ""are still very crucial, and help to pay our bills today"", he says.

CUSTOMER RETENTION

However, other customers remain important, and Avio Aero has held onto almost all of its third-party business since the takeover, including the accessory drive train on Pratt & Whitney's PW1000 family. Avio Aero has a 4% stake in Pratt & Whitney Canada's PW800 family for the Gulfstream G500/G600 and Dassault Falcon 6X business jets and supplies combustors for the PT6 family.

On the military side, it makes the power gearbox for the Airbus Military A400M's Europrop International TP400 and has a 20% share in the Eurofighter Typhoon's Eurojet EJ200. Firewalls are strong and ""we behave as a good business partner to our third-party customers"", insists Procacci.

As far as developments are concerned, the major areas of focus for Avio Aero – reflecting its current portfolio of products – are gearbox technologies, both power and accessory, low-pressure turbines, and combustion systems.

Avio Aero has also invested heavily in additive layer manufacturing, and is in, what Proccaci describes as, an ""industrialisation phase"", with its Cameri centre of excellence, near Milan, ""getting ready to build [titanium aluminide GE9X low-pressure turbine] blades by their thousands from next year"". The company is also expanding its Brindisi factory to host new machines that will laser-print the 12 or so parts it is producing for the Catalyst.

Avio Aero is also carrying out research with the Polytechnic Univerity of Bari into the potential of using additive technology for repair. ""We are really pushing the technology of what EMB [electron beam melting] can do,"" says Procacci.

Other important research and development projects include the latest iteration of the European Commission's Clean Sky initiative, designed to reduce emissions, noise and carbon dioxide produced by aircraft. ""Our aspiration is to become a programme leader on a system level, using our experience of the Catalyst engine,"" says Procacci. ""It is something we are focusing on with other European companies with a view to joining forces.""",Flight Global,0
"French aerostructures manufacturer Stelia Aerospace has acquired a majority shareholding in Toulouse-based digital modelling specialist Portalliance Engineering.

The two companies have co-operated for several years and established a strategic partnership in 2016.

Stelia says that it has been “supporting” Portalliance’s development by providing aerostructures know-how for the creation of digital tools to model aircraft components and simulate their behaviour, which in turn led to a “very significant” reduction in development cycles and improvement of complex structural designs.

“This majority stake acquisition is therefore a logical step and will enable Stelia Aerospace to benefit sustainably from this new technology,” the Airbus-owned company says.

Portalliance was established in 2006 and today employs 27 engineers, and generated last year revenue of €2 million ($2.3 million).

Describing the deal as a “real recognition of [Portalliance’s] technological expertise”, the firm’s chief executive Bruce de Witt states that the acquisition by Stelia will “enable the company to widen its field of application”.",Flight Global,0
"After at least three turbulent years, Italian aerostructures company Dema is counting on an injection of finance and confidence from new majority owner, Bybrook Capital, to set it on course for growth again. The London investment house purchased an 85% stake in the 25-year-old business earlier this year, installing a new board, but retaining founder Vincenzo Starace, who retains a minority share, as chief executive.

Speaking in his office in Dema's main factory in Somma Vesuviana, just outside Naples, Starace describes the effect of Bybrook's arrival as a ""revolution"" after ""a lot of financial difficulties between 2015 and 2017"", coupled with the loss of significant customers such as Boeing and Leonardo Helicopters.

Now, after an agreement with creditors, Dema has cleared its legacy debt, he says, and has working capital to pursue goals such as increasing its presence in the defence sector and ramping up production on major programmes including the Airbus A220 and Bombardier Global 7500 for the Canadian manufacturer's own aerostructures division.

In the aerostructures supply chain, with aircraft investments worth billions of dollars at stake, airframers count on the long-term viability of tier one and tier two manufacturers as much as the latter depend on the former for their livelihood.

Last year, Dema's financial problems prompted a nervous Boeing to drop the Italian company, which had been supplying the 787, making a troubling situation worse.

Leonardo Helicopters also axed Dema as a supplier to its AW139/169/189 range, for a different reason. The former AgustaWestland decided to take production to Poland, leaving Dema with a near-redundant factory in Brindisi. The combined effect was a drop in turnover from €62 million ($71 million) in 2012 to €38 million in 2017, although this should recover to around €55 million this year, says Starace.

The company's main customers now are Bombardier – Dema designed and now builds cockpits and empennages for the former CSeries and the largest Global business jet – as well as Leonardo's aerostructures division, for which it manufactures composite Boeing parts and structures for ATR. Dema also makes engine parts for Pratt & Whitney.

MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP

In May, Dema announced a ""co-operation agreement"" with Strata, the major aerostructures company in the Arab world. The deal came about after Dema in January bought the composite assembly assets and the contracts of GSE, a defunct business in Brindisi that had been supplying aerostructures to the Abu Dhabi-based firm.

The takeover of part of GSE – the Brindisi company's sheet metal activity is still trading separately under a state administrator – also saw Dema increase its ATR workshare. Dema is now responsible for 34% of the aircraft produced by the Airbus-Leonardo joint venture by weight, building the empennage, radome and doors.

There has been further good news. At the end of 2017, Dema took on direct responsibility for manufacturing the horizontal trailing edge and vertical leading edge on the A220, an activity that it had previously carried out through Leonardo. Starace also says there is a ""strong opportunity"" to win back work with Leonardo Helicopters, despite the decision to relocate most of it to Poland.

A bigger prize would be recapturing Boeing as a direct customer. GSE had contracts with the US airframer, which came with the acquisition and Dema continues to supply Boeing through Leonardo. ""We are in discussion,"" says Starace, who adds that Dema has ""invested a lot of capex already in the 787. We work very well through the other two channels, so why not directly?""

DEFENCE OFFENSIVE

Elsewhere, Dema is targeting the defence market, where it has started doing some work for Israel Aerospace Industries and is talking to Elbit and Turkish Aerospace. This sector was previously shut to Dema as a result of a stricture of one of its former shareholders – an Italian bank – against dealing with the arms industry.

Although most of its contracts are build-to-print, Dema also employs some 85 engineers, carrying out third-party projects for the likes of Leonardo – it is coming up with a new rudder design for ATR – and Gulfstream, for which it has conducted research and development work on thermoplastics as part of a project part-funded by the Apulia regional government.

Starace says he is hoping to ""close several deals"" by March 2019 in time to present a new business plan to the main shareholder. Just with the ramp-up of production under existing contracts, revenues should break the €100 million mark around the turn of the decade, Starace expects, although new business from the likes of Boeing could push that up further.

Another priority is a ""site optimisation programme"" for Dema's three factories, with each becoming a ""centre of excellence"" for a technology such as composites, sheet metal, and mechanical assembly. Coupled with this, Dema is looking at introducing new industrial disciplines such as the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, or continuous improvement, says Starace, who adds: ""We are very much focused on increasing our performance across all programmes in our portfolio.""",Flight Global,0

"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German defence ministry expects to announce next steps by the end of the year in its drive to replace 85 ageing Tornado fighter jets that will cost billions of euros.

German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen arrives to attend a ceremony at the lower house of parliament Bundestag in the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark National Mourning Day, Germany, November 18, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch

“There will be a decision this year,” a ministry spokesman said, citing a pledge in July by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen to move ahead with the programme in 2018. The spokesman gave no further details.

Sources familiar with the process said the ministry was likely to narrow the field of potential replacement jets from four to two — the Eurofighter Typhoon built by Airbus, Britain’s BAE Systems and Italy’s Leonardo SpA and most likely, the Lockheed Martin F-35.

“It’s another step in the process, not the actual procurement decision,” said one of the sources, noting that funds would first have to be earmarked in the German budget.

Von der Leyen favours a European solution, but the ministry also reviewed data submitted in April by the U.S. government on the F-35, and the F-15 and F/A-18E/F jets, both built by Boeing .

No comment was immediately available from Boeing or Lockheed. An Airbus spokesman said it was important for the process to move forward to enable the German air force to begin retiring the Tornado jets in 2025.

Several options have been studied, including buying one type of jet to replace the Tornado jets, a split buy of two aircraft types, and extending the life of the Tornados.

However the ministry in August asked potential bidders if they could deliver new warplanes before the initial target date of 2025, a move sources said reflected growing concerns about the cost of keeping the Tornados flying longer.

NUCLEAR CAPABILITY

A key factor will be the ability of the new jets to carry and deliver nuclear bombs. Germany is not a nuclear power, but hosts some U.S. nuclear warheads under NATO’s nuclear-sharing policy and operates a number of Tornados that can deliver them.

One proposal calls for Germany to buy 45 Lockheed F-35 jets to replace those Tornados, and about 75 new Eurofighters to replace both the other Tornados and a first batch of Eurofighters delivered between 2003 and 2008, sources said.

Buying F-35s would allow Germany to keep a mixed fleet of fighter jets, a requirement in its military strategy, while averting costly modifications to the Eurofighter.

Two of the sources said Germany had not yet commissioned a mandatory U.S. study of the certification issue, which could take 12 to 18 months to complete. Achieving certification for the Eurofighter could ultimately cost over 700 million euros and take well over seven years, they added.

Lockheed last week won a U.S. contract valued at up to $83.1 million to develop, integrate and test the needed software and hardware required for the F-35A to carry B61-12 nuclear bombs, with the work to be completed in February 2024.

Sources familiar with the process said that would allow Lockheed to offer Germany deliveries of F-35 aircraft a year or more ahead of the 2025 target, enabling pilots to begin a year or two of required training at a U.S. air base in Arizona.",Reuters,0

"Italian manufacturer Piaggio Aerospace has requested to be placed into receivership after declaring itself insolvent.

The board of the company made a request with the Italian government on 22 November to enter an ""extraordinary administration proceeding"": a local process specifically aimed at industrial insolvency and company restructuring.

The move comes less than a year after Piaggio Aerospace – owned by Abu Dhabi investment house Mubadala – approved a strategic five-year industrial plan designed to secure its long-term financial and operational stability.

Piaggio Aerospace

The strategy included a €255 million ($308 million) cash injection into the business by Mubadala, which took full ownership of the Villanova D’Albenga-headquartered venture in 2015. The plan also called for Mubadala to repurchase the company's bank debt, with the balance converted into equity ""in support of Piaggio Aerospace’s balance sheet"".

In a statement issued on 22 November, the board accepted that the restructuring plan has not worked. It says: ""Despite the commitment and hard work of everyone at Piaggio Aerospace, as well as the significant financial contribution made over the years by the shareholder, the key fundamental assumptions of the restructuring plan approved in 2017 have not materialised.""

The statement notes that the continued uncertainty and current market conditions mean the company is ""no longer financially sustainable"". The Piaggio Aerospace board has therefore taken the ""difficult decision to submit the application to enter the extraordinary administration proceeding given the company's insolvency status"", it says.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Spraying sun-dimming chemicals high above the Earth to slow global warming could be “remarkably inexpensive”, costing about $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period, according to a study by U.S. scientists.

Some researchers say the geo-engineering technique known as stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) could limit rising temperatures that are causing climate change.

As yet unproven and hypothetical, it would involve the use of huge hoses, cannons or specially designed aircraft to spray large quantities of sulphate particles into the upper layer of the atmosphere to act as a reflective barrier against sunlight.

Total costs to launch a hypothetical SAI effort 15 years from now would be $3.5 billion, scientists at Harvard University said in a report published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, adding that average annual operating costs would be about $2.25 billion a year over 15 years.

Discounting other methods of deployment because of cost and feasibility, the research assumes a special aircraft can be designed to fly at an altitude of about 20km and carry a load of 25 tonnes.

After direct input from several aerospace and engine companies, the scientists said they have developed a design that could be suitable and could be ready to be deployed in 15 years, aiming to cut the rate of temperature change in half.

The scientists emphasised that this is merely a hypothetical scenario.

“We make no judgment about the desirability of SAI. We simply show that a hypothetical deployment programme commencing 15 years hence, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would indeed be technically possible from an engineering perspective. It would also be remarkably inexpensive,” the report said.

There are risks to such unproven potential technologies. Scientists have said SAI could result in negative consequences such as causing droughts or extreme weather in other parts of the world, harm crop yields as well as potential public health and governance issues.

It also does not address the issue of rising carbon dioxide emissions, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.

Commenting on the study, Phil Williamson at the University of East Anglia said: “Such scenarios are fraught with problems - and international agreement to go ahead with such action would seem near-impossible to achieve.”",Reuters,0

"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - A race by aerospace giants Rolls-Royce (RR.L) and Airbus (AIR.PA) to stockpile parts before Brexit is pushing some small suppliers to breaking point.

With just over four months until it leaves, and political bickering continuing, Britain is yet to sign off on its divorce terms with the European Union, forcing companies to prepare for a disorderly exit from the world’s largest trading bloc. Supporting over 120,000 jobs, the UK’s aerospace sector is the second largest in the world and depends on smooth cross-border trade. This makes it vulnerable to any checks and delays that would snarl up supply chains and throw an industry-wide ramp-up to meet surging global demand off course.

A string of suppliers have told Reuters they are either stockpiling parts, producing extra goods to be stored by their customers, or holding out to see whether a deal can be struck.

Bitrez, a speciality chemicals manufacturer based in north west England, said some customers now ask suppliers to provide material to their premises, with the customer only invoiced as the stock gets used.

“Most of our larger customers have imposed or pushed for consignment stock deals so this has allowed them to increase stocks and provide a buffer,” Paul Jones, MD of the 24 million pound-turnover company said.

“Brexit is the driver for it.”

CASH FLOW

Such demands put pressure on the cash-flow of small companies and Paul Adams, head of aerospace at consultancy Vendigital, said that was one of the biggest short-term risks for smaller aerospace suppliers.

“When you’re talking about adding time to a process what you’re really talking about is consuming cash, mainly in the form of inventory, but also possibly resources to help with that,” he said. Even this sort of stockpiling would only realistically provide a limited extension due to restrictions on space and cost implications. And not all companies have the capability or space to step up at all. “The aerospace guys have started stockpiling stuff, we’re seeing that,” said Tony Worsley, the managing director of Elder, a manufacturer of metal and polymer components. But the family-owned, 4 million pound turnover company with 30 employees, can’t stockpile all the materials it will need if a no-deal Brexit leads to days or weeks of supplies at UK ports. “I haven’t got the space, the resources,” he said. Britain’s aerospace sector includes small engineers across the country producing parts for the wings of the Airbus A320 plane, the Rolls-Royce engines which power passenger aircrafts, and the F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets. The industry had already been on a steep production curve as the likes of Airbus, Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Pratt and Witney and others race to meet demand for jets, particularly from China.

Weaker cash positions in smaller firms can add to the risks embedded in the supply chains of larger quoted companies, which are already rising due to the output hikes.

Global commercial aircraft production will reach 1,800 planes by 2022, up over 20 percent from 2017, Deloitte has said. Andrew Mair, head of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, a regional industry body which represents about a quarter of the UK’s sector, said the recent ramp up meant it was impossible for some small companies to produce extra inventory. “They can’t keep up with current volume requirements, they cannot stockpile,” he said.

The complex nature of building air frames and aero-engines means even the smallest suppliers can cause delays. The A380 is made up of 4 million components made by 1,500 companies in 30 countries, while 18,000 components go into Rolls-Royce engines.

Adams said some suppliers hold power in the short term because they’re in a unique position to do what they do. “They can and will push back,” he said. CLOCK TICKING As the Brexit clock ticks down, the bigger companies are worried that their own contingency plans are only as robust as those of the thousands of smaller suppliers on which they rely. Airbus, which has 4,000 companies in its UK supply chain, said in July it was activating its Brexit contingency plans to build up “buffers” because it thought the British government’s strategy was unravelling.

“Our teams across Europe are in daily contact with suppliers about a range of subjects; we have both written to, and surveyed, our suppliers regarding Brexit and are working with those companies,” said a spokesman for Airbus.

A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said: “We are working hard to ensure that our supply chain has all the relevant information they need to plan for Brexit and we believe our suppliers will be able to take the steps necessary to ensure continuity of supply of both goods and services.”

Rolls-Royce’s CEO said last week the engine-maker was still intending to stockpile parts, to give it “the logistical capacity that we need to carry on running our business.”

That fits with what small suppliers are starting to see. Mark Venables, the managing director of Alloy Wire International, a central England-based provider or specialist wire, said customers were asking for its Brexit plans. Alloy Wire has, in fact, been taking on extra warehousing and building up its own buffers. “We have been preparing for the last few years because we have been in effect carrying extra stock,” he said. “We took another unit on in August last year and have invested more than $5 million in material over the past twelve months - the biggest investment we’ve ever made in stock.” If Britain can emerge through the Brexit deadline relatively unscathed then there could be a silver lining and company bosses, like Mark Crouchen, of Rockwood Composites, a 20 person, 1.5 million pound turnover, are hopeful.

Corporate spending could spike if Britain agrees a good divorce deal, British finance minister Philip Hammond has said, following a period when companies have been “sitting on their hands” as they wait to see the outcome of the negotiations. South west England-based Rockwood, a maker of composite material parts used, for example in cabin doors and the decoy system in the Eurofighter, said its orders were all bespoke.

It was hard to blame Brexit directly, but Crouchen said he had seen delays over the last two years. “But we’ve certainly seen a big surge in work for next year and beyond. It’s very, very unusual.”",Reuters,0
"NAIROBI/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian Airlines is accelerating its strategy of weaving a patchwork of new African routes to soak up traffic on the continent and fly customers towards its more lucrative flights to rapidly expanding Asian markets.

FILE PHOTO: Ethiopian Airlines' newly acquired Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, with a seating capacity of 400 passengers, arrives at the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia November 8, 2013. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri/File Photo

With a long-delayed African “open skies” revolution still mired in red tape, Ethiopian [ETHA.UL] has been snapping up stakes in small carriers around the continent to pre-empt potential rivals and become the dominant pan-African airline.

The carrier is in talks with Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo Republic and Djibouti about either launching airlines or securing landing spots, CEO Tewolde GebreMariam told Reuters.

He also said in May the airline was looking to set up carriers in Equatorial Guinea and Guinea through joint ventures.

“The task of African integration is not easy,” Tewolde said in an interview. “The context is the need for air transport. There is huge demand. We are responding to it.”

Ethiopian’s push comes as Middle Eastern rivals who expanded heavily in Africa are feeling some pain from overcapacity, while African carriers such as South African Airways and Kenya Airways (KQNA.NR) are on the back foot after losing money for years.

The success or failure of Ethiopian’s plan is being watched by long-haul competitors such as Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS) and suppliers led by Boeing (BA.N) and, more recently, Airbus (AIR.PA).

Ethiopian’s fortunes are also important for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government, which has said it plans to sell a minority stake in the airline to domestic and foreign investors as part of broad economic reform pledges.

Ethiopian unveiled its 15-year expansion strategy in 2010, and started small. First it helped launch ASKY Airlines in the West African country of Togo and then acquired a 49 percent stake in Malawi’s flag carrier in southern Africa in 2013.

Since May, Ethiopian has announced plans to launch an airline in Mozambique, relaunched Zambia’s flag carrier, established a new airline in Chad to cover West and Central Africa and resumed flights to Somalia after a 41-year hiatus.

REGIONAL HUBS

The prize is growing fast. Air traffic in Africa is forecast to grow 6 percent a year, twice as quickly as mature markets and faster than any other region over the next two decades.

Ethiopian is hoping to snare a greater share of capacity on flights between cities in Africa, which are already 90-percent controlled by African carriers, according to data firm OAG.

In most cases so far, Ethiopian has taken minority stakes in “start-up” airlines and tried to implant its management culture, often in nations haunted by costly failures of state carriers.

Slideshow (3 Images)

Tewolde also wants to claw back market share on routes to and from the continent, dominated by Turkish and Gulf carrier Emirates. This year, 61 percent of capacity to or from Africa has been controlled by non-African carriers, says OAG.

There are big risks.

Ethiopian is spending tens of millions of dollars in some of Africa’s toughest markets and the strategy of buying minority stakes to get a foothold abroad has failed spectacularly for some, such as Abu Dhabi’s Etihad.

Analysts worry accelerated expansion may spread Ethiopian too thinly if traffic doesn’t pick up fast enough at its new hubs in Togo, Malawi and Chad.

The regional hubs are designed partly to channel customers to Ethiopian’s main hub in Addis Ababa and so fill its direct flights to the Middle East and Asia.

OPEN SKIES?

There are also concerns that none is in a major African city. Lome is far smaller than west African cities such as Nigeria’s economic capital Lagos, or Abidjan in Ivory Coast, while Chad’s dusty desert capital is even smaller.

""You want to build (a hub) in a place where you are going to get local traffic and connecting traffic,"" said Craig Jenks, president of consultancy Airline/Aircraft Projects Inc aap.aero/index.html.

Tewolde said the new airline in Chad would draw in passengers from Cameroon, Central African Republic, Niger, northern Nigeria and Sudan.

Yamlaksira Getachew, a management professor at Loyola Marymount University, warned Zambia’s relaunched flag carrier could steal traffic from Ethiopian’s existing southern African hub in neighbouring Malawi.

Ethiopian has been forced to adopt the piecemeal approach to expansion because full air transport liberalisation has failed to materialise, despite several attempts.

In 1999, 44 African countries signed the Yamoussoukro Decision in Ivory Coast’s capital giving airlines freedom to ferry passengers between two foreign countries.

But the agreement was barely implemented as governments moved to protect domestic carriers.

To try to revive the stalled process, 23 African governments signed another deal this year to forge a single aviation market.

So far, Ethiopian’s plan appears to be working. It says it has clocked average growth of 25 percent a year since 2010 and expects to carry nearly 10.6 million passengers this year, up from 3.7 million eight years ago.

Unlike many African rivals, it is also making money. Net profit rose 2 percent to $233 million (181.31 million pounds) in its 2017-18 fiscal year.

It says Western banks are helping to fund plans to boost its fleet of 108 planes, with 66 more on order.

"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates signalled on Friday a British academic it jailed for life on spying charges could be freed after his family appealed for clemency in a case that has strained ties between the longstanding allies.

Matthew Hedges, 31, was sentenced on Wednesday on charges of spying for the British government, in a move described as deeply disappointing by Prime Minister Theresa May.

“Mr Hedges’ family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request,” the UAE’s ambassador to London, Sulaiman Hamid Almazroui, said.

“We have an extremely close partnership with the UK,” he told reporters. “Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached.”

The doctoral student at Durham University has been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit.

“We have asked for clemency - we will wait to see what happens,” Hedges’ wife Daniela Tejada told Reuters after the ambassador spoke. She denies he is a spy.

His family have cast him as a talented researcher who fell foul of the UAE’s security and justice system. The UAE cast him as a British spy who was given a fair trial for grave espionage offences.

“We hope the UAE now looks favourably on the family’s request for clemency,” a spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office said.

PARDON

The Gulf state does not dictate verdicts to its courts and there was full and proper legal process in Hedges’ case, the ambassador said. There had not been a “five minute show trial” as he said some media had reported.

“This was an extremely serious case. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood and national security must be a top priority,” said Almazroui, adding that everyone had the right to request a pardon.

“This was an unusual case: many researchers visit the UAE freely every year without breaking our laws,” he said.

Hedges’ family said the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research.

“Matt was held in an undisclosed location in solitary confinement for over 5 months, with no charge, no lawyer and very limited consular access,” his wife said.

“The judicial system in the UAE and the UK cannot be compared. I was in the courtroom and the hearing lasted less than 5 minutes,” she added.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industry’s voluntary halt in previously authorised arms shipments to Saudi Arabia after the killing of a journalist at the Saudi consulate in Turkey is slated to last until mid-January, industry sources said on Friday.

It was not immediately clear whether the halt in deliveries would be extended again or whether the companies would insist that the German government formally revoke the licenses then.

German firms are not eligible for compensation for lost revenue unless the government has taken that step, according to one industry source.

“The companies have agreed to halt deliveries for now, but the situation may change if Saudi Arabia begins to demand damages for delayed deliveries,” the source said.

Germany last week banned 18 Saudis suspected of involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi from much of Europe on Monday and expanded a halt in arms sales to the kingdom.

It had already suspended the approval of future export licences to Saudi Arabia but on Nov. 19 said it had also worked with industry to stop shipments of arms sales already approved.

No specific timetable was given at the time, but industry sources said an agreement had been struck to revisit the issue in early to mid-January.

A spokesman for the economy ministry declined to comment on the timetable or the value of the goods held up.

The halt mainly affects a number of patrol boats being built for Saudi Arabia by privately held Luerrsen, which may jeopardise 300 jobs at a shipyard in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and four Cobra radar systems to be built by a consortium that includes France’s Thales, Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States.

Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday that the goods were valued at around 2.5 billion euros.

It remains unclear how the freeze will impact multinational programmes such as the Eurofighter, built by a consortium of firms in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.

BAE Systems, which led the Eurofighter campaign to win a 10 billion pound contract from Saudi Arabia for 48 new Eurofighter Typhoon jets, is still finalising that deal after signing a memorandum of understanding in March.

"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed nationwide litigation over the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in which victims’ families sought to hold the carrier, its insurer Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) and Boeing Co (BA.N) liable for the still-unexplained disaster.

U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in Washington ruled on Wednesday night that the wrongful death and product liability litigation, encompassing 40 lawsuits, did not belong in the United States.

She said the case belonged in Malaysia, which has an “overwhelming interest” in and “substantial nexus” to the March 8, 2014 disappearance of Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 heading to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board.

“At its core, this case is about the unexplained disappearance of a passenger plane operated by Malaysia Airlines as part of its national air carrier fleet following its departure from a Malaysian airport,” Jackson wrote.

“Litigation in the United States related to the Flight MH370 disaster is inconvenient,” she added.

The 61-page decision is a setback for plaintiffs from the United States, Australia, China, India and Malaysia who represented more than 100 Flight MH370 passengers, including from Japan.

The plane is believed to have crashed in the south Indian Ocean after veering far off course, but no remains or large pieces of wreckage have been found.

Flight MH370’s disappearance remains one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries.

A 495-page report from Malaysian investigators in July offered no clear answers about what happened.

The plaintiffs sued under the Montreal Convention, an international treaty governing air transportation incidents, and various U.S. state laws.

Mary Schiavo, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said in an email on Friday her clients were preparing for a June 2019 trial in Kuala Lumpur over the plane.

Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, their respective lawyers, and lawyers for other plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The carrier was insured by Allianz’s Global Corporate & Specialty SE unit, according to Wednesday’s decision. Hugo Kidston, a spokesman for the unit, declined to comment.

"BERLIN/BEIJING/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - When G20 world leaders met for the first time in 2008 their mission was a desperate one - to rescue the global economy from the worst financial crisis in more than 70 years. They were successful.

Ten years on, that picture of unity in the face of economic calamity is in the rear-view mirror. Leaders of the G20 industrialized nations meeting in Argentina next week are expected to struggle to agree on a joint statement on two of the biggest, and thorniest, global issues on their agenda - trade and climate change.

Officials in European and Asian capitals helping to prepare for the meeting said they were cautiously optimistic that a communique would be issued when the two-day meeting ends on Dec. 1.

But many said it would likely be watered down to try to ensure approval from U.S. President Donald Trump, an avowed skeptic of man-made climate change who has adopted protectionist trade policies and a more isolationist foreign policy.

Recent history suggests those who draft the communique face a tough challenge when they begin their work in earnest in Buenos Aires on Monday.

Last weekend, officials from countries attending a major Asia-Pacific summit failed to agree on a joint communique for the first time as the United States clashed with China over trade and security.

In May Trump rejected a statement by fellow leaders of the G7 industrialized economies after a tense gathering ended in acrimony, again over tariffs and trade.

“It’s a club that is even more difficult to manage than the G7,” said a French diplomatic source. “Let’s face it. The issues are difficult, the talks have been difficult since last year. It will be the case again this year, maybe even tougher.”

It will be the first time the leaders have met since Trump imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports to force concessions from Beijing on greater access to Chinese markets, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft.

China responded with import tariffs on U.S. goods.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned this week that an escalation in the trade war - the U.S. tariff rate on $200 billion in Chinese goods is set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on Jan. 1 - would impede global economic growth.

Officials from some G20 countries, anxious to see a swift end to the U.S.-China trade war, are hopeful but not confident that a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of G20 may yield at least a partial ceasefire.

But in the United States and China there is pessimism.

Within the White House there is uncertainty over how hard Trump is prepared to push Xi during their talks on trade and other disputes as the president sorts through sometimes conflicting advice from his own top aides, a senior Trump official said.

“Expectations (on the meeting) are low. But keeping the personal relationship going is an extremely high priority,” the U.S. official said, referring to Trump and Xi, who have sought to forge a close working relationship despite the tensions between their countries, the world’s two biggest economies.

China’s main goal at the G20 is to get the United States to refrain from raising the tariffs in January, said Chinese economists and academics. But Xi would not be bullied into making a bad deal.

“Even if they are able to reach a small agreement, the leaders of China and the United States cannot reach a fundamental agreement, so there would not be a ceasefire in the trade war,” said Shi Yinhong, the head of the Center for American Studies at Beijing’s elite Renmin University who has advised the Chinese government on diplomacy.

Trump said on Thursday he was well prepared for his meeting with Xi.

“It’s not like, ‘Oh gee, I’m going to sit down and study.’ I know every ingredient. I know every stat. I know it better than anybody knows it. And my gut has always been right. And we’re doing very well. And I will tell you China very much wants to make a deal.”

Trump will also meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders have not met face to face since a bilateral summit in July in Helsinki that prompted Trump critics to accuse him of cozying up to the Kremlin.

‘NO ALTERNATIVE’

G20 leaders are also expected to discuss reform of the World Trade Organization, but officials said it was unlikely any agreement would be reached.

The United States is increasingly skeptical of the WTO’s ability to resolve international trade disputes. The European Union is also pushing to reform the body to make it better able to address modern trade problems.

European countries are anxious that the final communique refer to the fight against climate change, a senior European Union official said. Trump has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, casting doubt on the science underpinning the agreement.

Despite disagreements on key issues and the United States’ growing skepticism about the usefulness of multilateral bodies, G20 members insist the forum remains an important opportunity for world leaders to meet and exchange views on pressing issues.

“Its existence itself helps us gather quickly and discuss key issues on a global level when needed,” said a senior G20 official in Asia.

A senior German official involved in G20 preparations said Germany remained committed to G20 as a place for multilateral and bilateral discussions despite the current tensions.

The deal would be by far Logitech’s largest acquisition and would illustrate the company’s push to diversify its business. It would come as Logitech and Plantronics seek to keep down manufacturing costs following the introduction of tariffs on imports from China into the United States.

Logitech has offered more than $2.2 billion (£1.7 billion) to acquire Plantronics, one of the sources said. As of the end of trading on Friday, Plantronics had a market capitalisation of about $2 billion.

If the negotiations prove successful, a deal between Logitech and Plantronics could come as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that it was also possible that no agreement would be reached.

The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Plantronics declined to comment, while Logitech did not respond to a request for comment.

Plantronics shares jumped 5.6 percent to $56.50 on the news in after hours trading in New York on Friday.

Logitech’s and Plantronics’ businesses have been under pressure as a result of new offerings being developed, not just from network gear makers such as Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), but also from major technology companies such as Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) and Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

Founded in 1981, Logitech has been countering declining sales of personal computers by focussing on consumer accessories that are benefiting from the growth of cloud computing, such as gaming, music, smart home connectivity and video conferencing. The Lausanne-based company has a market capitalisation of $5.6 billion.

Last year, Logitech acquired ASTRO Gaming for $85 million in cash to expand in the video game sector.

Santa Cruz, California-based Plantronics makes unified communications systems, wireless headsets, conferencing systems, and some software, which it sells to businesses and consumers.

Founded in 1961, Plantronics’ first products were lightweight headsets for airline pilots. It later became known for selling headsets to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including the ones worn by Neil Armstrong during his first moonwalk in 1969.

A sale of Plantronics would come on the heels of the company’s $2 billion acquisition in July of U.S. video-conferencing equipment maker Polycom Inc.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Saturday it had received sanctions exemptions from the U.N. Security Council for a joint survey of inter-Korean railways, the first step towards reconnecting rail and road links cut during the 1950-53 Korean War.

In April, the leaders of the two Koreas agreed to adopt practical steps to reconnect railways and roads as part of efforts to improve bilateral relationships.

“The sanctions exemption has big implications given that the project has garnered recognition and support from the United States and the international society,” South Korea’s presidential spokesperson Kim Eui-kyeom said.

He expressed hope of quick construction of the railways, which he said will take inter-Korean cooperation to a new level.

South Korea requested an exemption for deliveries of fuel and other equipment needed to conduct the railway survey in the North, Yonhap News Agency said.

Pyongyang is under wide-ranging U.N. sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.

In October, the two Koreas agreed to carry out joint field studies on transport plans, with a ground-breaking ceremony in late November and early December.

But the plan was delayed amid stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang following an unprecedented summit in June at which the two sides agreed to work toward nuclearisation and peace on the Korean peninsula.

Negotiations have since made little headway, with Pyongyang upset by Washington’s insistence that international sanctions must remain until it gives up its nuclear weapons.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A former Nissan Motor (7201.T) executive arrested along with ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn has defended Ghosn’s compensation, saying it was discussed with other officials and paid out appropriately, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Saturday.

In his first reported comments since his arrest on Monday, Greg Kelly was also quoted by NHK as saying that he had worked for the good of Nissan rather than just following Ghosn’s instructions.

"BELFAST (Reuters) - Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Saturday called for the government to appoint a minister to prepare for a “no-deal” British exit from the European Union in order to increase London’s leverage in talks with Brussels.

He also called for Prime Minister Theresa May to withhold much of Britain’s exit payment, to renegotiate its withdrawal deal and to dump the Northern Ireland backstop, while avoiding triggering a no-deal Brexit.

The withdrawal treaty’s ‘backstop’ provision could ultimately align Northern Ireland more closely with the EU than the rest of the United Kingdom if no other way can be found to avoid a hard border with EU member the Republic of Ireland.

The proposals received a rapturous reception from the audience at the annual conference of Northern Ireland’s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, but Johnson did not explain how he would secure EU acquiescence to the plan.

EU leaders have repeatedly said they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, and observers have suggested Britain would have to make major concessions elsewhere for it to be changed.

May is due formally to agree the withdrawal deal with the EU’s remaining 27 members on Sunday.

“Unless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us – a satellite state,” Johnson told the crowd. Britain, he said, risked “economic and political humiliation.”

“We need a secretary of state for no-deal or WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms, with real powers across Whitehall (Britain’s civil service) to make things happen,” Johnson told the conference, winning a standing ovation.

“I do not believe that we will exit without a deal – that is totally unnecessary – but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations.”

Johnson, one of Prime Minister Theresa May’s fiercest critics since he quit her cabinet in July, has not formally called for her ouster.

But he is one of the leaders of a large group of Conservative members of parliament opposing May’s strategy and is regularly touted as a possible contender to replace her as Conservative Party leader should she fall over Brexit.

May does not currently have enough support in the British parliament to ratify the deal.

She has warned lawmakers they have a simple choice: back her deal or risk ushering in a no deal departure, a delay to Brexit or possibly no Brexit at all.

Speaking to the BBC, Johnson said he did not believe a no-deal Brexit was likely, but added: “I don’t think it will be nearly as bad as some people suggest.”

Johnson, who is known for his colourful language and at-time outlandish proposals, repeated a call for the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, a project that several experts have dismissed as impractical.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain’s draft deal to leave the European Union is the best available solution to safeguard the economy and start to reunite a divided country, Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Saturday.

Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet EU leaders on Sunday in Brussels to sign off on the Brexit deal although objections from Spain over Gibraltar could yet derail the plans.

Even if it is approved, May faces a tough battle to get the deal through the British parliament in the face of objections from some of her own Conservative Party lawmakers and allies in Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

“This deal is a way of Britain leaving the European Union ... with minimum negative impact on our economy,” Hammond told the BBC.

“The only thing that is holding the economy back at the moment is uncertainty about our relationship with the European Union,” he added.

“If we were to leave the EU without a deal I have no doubt that the consequences for the economy would be very serious indeed, very disruptive and very negative for jobs, for prosperity in the future.”

Hammond, who met DUP leader Arlene Foster on Friday, defended the agreement as good for a country where divisions have been exposed by the June 2016 EU referendum.

“Remaining in the EU after a clear referendum decision to leave EU would be utterly debilitating to our politics, it would completely undermine confidence in the political system and leave large numbers of people feeling betrayed,” he said.

Speaking after an EU leaders’ summit, Sanchez said Spain’s position over Gibraltar, a British territory since 1713, was stronger after the agreement of a Brexit deal on Sunday because Spanish policy effectively became EU policy.

“We are going to resolve a conflict that has been going for over 300 years,” Pedro Sanchez told a news conference, adding he had said the same thing to British Prime Minister Theresa May, who met the EU’s 27 leaders to endorse the withdrawal treaty that she will now put to the British parliament.

Asked if Spain would seek a discussion over joint sovereignty once Britain leaves the bloc on March 29, 2019, Sanchez said: “We will discuss all issues.”

The small peninsula attached to Spain is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations. Spain has long claimed sovereignty.

Gibraltar residents rejected shared sovereignty with Spain in a referendum in 2002. “The Rock”, as it is known by locals, is due to leave the EU along with the United Kingdom.

May told reporters on Sunday that “Gibraltar is British” and that when she negotiated for Britain, she did so for the territory, but declined to go into more details.

SPAIN ‘WINS’

However, given that 96 percent of its population voted in Britain’s 2016 referendum to remain in the EU, the mood was now different, Spanish officials said.

“This puts Spain in a position of strength in negotiations with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar that we have not had until now,” Sanchez told reporters after the summit.

He was referring to a 1986 agreement when Spain joined the bloc and had to adapt its Gibraltar policy to British policy within the EU. He said that situation was now being reversed, a view also shared by many in the bloc, one EU official said.

Signalling such support, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said many Europeans did not realise the importance of Gibraltar for Spain.

“We all lose (with Brexit), especially the United Kingdom, but regarding Gibraltar, Spain wins,” said Sanchez, who made no attempt to hide his delight during the news conference.

Shared sovereignty in Gibraltar, home to 30,000 people, a British naval base and an airport partly contested by Spain, could echo similar arrangements in Europe such as Andorra and the Isle of Man, said Ignacio Molina, an analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute think-tank in Madrid.

“There could be a special postal service embedded into both Spanish Correos and Royal Mail, local number plates with the European flag, healthcare provision in Spain, possible Spanish police action in Gibraltar,” he said.

“Of course, the airport would be shared, there would be no control of persons at the border,” he added.

Gibraltar’s airport dispute centres around sovereignty over a narrow strip of land connecting Gibraltar to Spain. Spain says the isthmus was not included in the treaty ceding Gibraltar to Britain and has always been Spanish territory.",Reuters,0

Protesters chanted slogans and carried signs reading “For Those Who Aren’t With Us” and “Justice”. In Madrid, the protest ended with a reading of the names of the 44 women killed in Spain last year in incidents of domestic violence.

Earlier this year, women across Spain went on strike and held hundreds of rallies to protest against gender inequality. The two largest unions said around 6 million women took part in the strike, the first of its kind to be held in Spain on International Women’s Day.

Spanish courts received more than 166,000 gender violence complaints in 2017, up 16 percent on the previous year, according to the General Council of the Judiciary.",Reuters,0
"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L), has not yet seen a slowdown in its key markets and aims to more than double the number of cars it makes by 2025, its chief executive said on Sunday.

The British automaker, whose sports cars feature in James Bond films, is on target to produce 6,400 vehicles this year despite the pressures of slowing Chinese demand and worries over the impact of Brexit.

The company is looking to manufacture 14,000 cars by 2025 with the size of the company growing four-fold from what it was in 2014, said CEO Andy Palmer.

It will also become a very profitable company, he said.

In 2017, Aston Martin made a pre-tax profit of 87 million pounds ($111 million), its first annual pre-tax profit since 2010.

“The rich are getting richer, they want more personalization,” Palmer told Reuters in Abu Dhabi on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where Aston Martin is the title sponsor of the Red Bull Formula One team.

“On the other hand, the car industry is getting more and more commoditized because of technology,” he added.

Palmer dismissed the notion that there was a slowdown in key markets. In the year-to-date the company saw turnover grow 185 percent in the U.S; 133 percent growth in Asia-Pacific and 118 percent growth in China, he said.

“The retail part is not in dispute. China was slow, but not for us,” he said.

The company is confident it will achieve higher profits in 2018 over last year minus the one-off costs such as those related to its initial public offering in October.

“If you focus on EBITDA, then yes we obviously will see growth. Excluding one-off costs, last 12 months, it all looks very healthy,” he said, without citing figures.

Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to 207 million pounds in 2017.

The company is on track to launch its new sport utility vehicle (SUV) in late 2019. It is betting on existing Aston Martin customers who also have an SUV in their garage, Palmer said, adding that demand for SUV’s in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region was similar in size to China.",Reuters,0
"LILLE, France (Reuters) - Croatia captain Zeljko Krajan hailed his “dream team” after Marin Cilic sealed a second Davis Cup title for the Balkan nation by beating France’s Lucas Pouille on Sunday.

Just as he was on Friday against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the 30-year-old world number seven was in commanding form to crush Pouille 7-6(3) 6-3 6-3 to give the Croats a winning 3-1 lead.

He did not drop a set in his two singles while Croatian number two Borna Coric had given the favourites a flying start on Friday with an easy win over Jeremy Chardy.

Neither Cilic nor Coric dropped serve all weekend as Croatia emulated the 2005 side which beat Slovakia in the final.

“This is the one of the best teams we’ve ever had — it’s like a dream team,” Krajan said. “After seven years on the bench (as captain) it’s an honour for me to be here.

“My singles players not only didn’t lose a set, they didn’t lose serve in three matches which is an unbelievable achievement and shows you the quality that we produced.”

Victory was especially sweet for Cilic who had bitter memories of the 2016 final against Argentina to banish.

In that match in Zagreb, he was two sets to the good against Juan Martin del Potro and required just one more set to give Croatia a match-winning 3-1 lead.

Del Potro battled back to win in five before Federico Delbonis beat Ivo Karlovic to give Argentina victory.

“I always sleep well,” the 30-year-old Cilic, who made his debut in 2006, said, when asked whether that Del Potro defeat occasionally kept him awake at night.

“I’m just proud of the team today after everything we’ve been through. “This is definitely one of the best moments of my career. There was a lot of pressure but I played a hell of a match today and deservedly won.”

Cilic said the fact that the final was the last in the competition’s current guise added to the joy.

“It’s historic,” he said. “I have been part of this team since 2006. I have seen a few generations of players, I have seen a lot of tennis, a lot of wins, a lot of matches lost too.

“It’s amazing to finish a chapter of this kind with the way we played and the atmosphere that was in the team.”

France captain Yannick Noah, who will step down from his third stint in charge, said his team had been outplayed as they failed in their bid to win the title two years in succession.

“The guys did the maximum,” Noah said. “Sometimes the bar is too high. That’s my feeling.

“We lost to a better team. We did everything we could to be at this level with the Croatian team. We just went to their locker-room to congratulate them. I think they’re beautiful winners and they deserve it.”",Reuters,0
"LILLE, France (Reuters) - Marin Cilic clinched Croatia’s second Davis Cup title by crushing France’s Lucas Pouille 7-6(3) 6-3 6-3 to give his side a decisive 3-1 lead in an historic final at Lille’s Stade Pierre Mauroy on Sunday.

The powerful world number seven was relentless as he snuffed out any hope of a famous French fightback — giving Pouille little chance of extending the last final in the 118-year-old competition’s current guise into a deciding fifth rubber.

Pouille, 24, did not have a single break point and despite pushing Cilic hard in the first set, he lost the last four points of the tiebreak and never threatened a comeback.

Cilic wasted four set points when Pouille battled back from 0-40 down at 2-5 in the second set but with his own serve rock-solid he calmly moved into a two-set lead.

The mainly French 22,000 crowd kept roaring their support for Pouille, but it was the Croatia contingent, decked out in their distinctive red and white, who would soon be celebrating.

Cilic broke for a 3-2 lead in the third set and then closed in for the kill when Pouille served at 3-5.

The Frenchman saved two match points from 0-40 but Cilic would not be denied and finished it off with a delightful lob.

Immediately the 30-year-old former U.S. Open champion was swamped by a swarm of his team mates as Croatia could begin the party after emulating their triumph of 2005.

Croatia’s sports-mad President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic was among the fans at courtside to savour a landmark title which offered a measure of consolation after France beat Croatia in this year’s soccer World Cup final.

“It’s not every day that you become a world champion,” Cilic, draped in a Croatian flag, said on court.

“For us it’s a dream come true, for this nation. You can see the fans are so passionate and they are here enjoying themselves. In Croatia it’s going to be incredible too.”

SPECIAL PLACE

Whatever happens in the future Croatia’s win will have a special place in the record books as this was the last ‘one on one’ final before the competition undergoes a major revamp.

The 16-team World Group, established in 1981, will be scrapped next year in favour of an 18-nation World Cup-style finals week that will take place in Madrid.

Hosts and defending champions France had begun the day holding out hope of becoming the first team to overturn a 2-0 deficit in the final since Australia beat the U.S. in 1939.

But there was to be no fairytale ending for French captain Yannick Noah in his last match in charge of Les Bleus.

Noah had surprisingly left Pouille, the highest-ranked player in his team, out of Friday’s opening singles matches and the gamble backfired as Jeremy Chardy was hammered by Borna Coric and Cilic beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

After Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert won Saturday’s doubles to keep the tie alive, Noah restored Pouille in a bid to take down Croatian talisman Cilic.

He hung on grimly in the first set, saving a break point at 4-4 with a beautiful dropshot. Cilic twice held serve to stay in the opener and then struck in the tiebreak.

He opened a 5-3 lead then latched onto a Pouille serve to crush a forehand winner before converting his first set point with a dropshot of his own.

An animated Noah was up and down out of his seat, firing up his man and the crowd. In contrast his opposite number Zeljko Krajan sat back and let Cilic go calmly about his business.

Cilic’s weight of shot allowed him to break decisively in the fifth game of the second set.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - NASA’s first robotic lander designed to study the deep interior of a distant world hurtled closer to Mars on course for a planned touchdown on Monday after a six-month voyage through space.

Traveling 301 million miles (548 million km) from Earth, the Mars InSight spacecraft was due to reach its destination on the dusty, rock-strewn surface of the Red Planet at about 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT).

The mission control team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles prepared to conduct a final adjustment to the InSight’s flight path on Sunday to maneuver the spacecraft closer toward its entry point over Mars.

If all goes according to plan, InSight will streak into the pink Martian sky nearly 24 hours later at 12,000 miles per hour (19,310 kilometers per hour). Its 77-mile descent to the surface will be slowed by atmospheric friction, a giant parachute and retro rockets. When it lands 6-1/2 minutes later, it will be traveling a mere 5 mph (8 kph).

The stationary probe, launched from California in May, will then pause for 16 minutes for the dust to settle, literally, around the landing site before its disc-shaped solar arrays unfurl to provide power.

Engineers at JPL hope to get real-time electronic confirmation of the spacecraft’s safe arrival from miniature satellites that were launched along with InSight and will fly past Mars.

The JPL controllers also expect to receive a photo of the probe’s surroundings on the flat, smooth Martian plain close to the planet’s equator called the Elysium Planitia.

The site is roughly 373 miles (600 km) from the 2012 landing spot of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity, the last spacecraft sent to the Red Planet by NASA.

The smaller, 880-pound (360 kg) InSight - its name is short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - marks the 21st U.S.-launched Martian exploration including the Mariner fly-by missions of the 1960s. Nearly two dozen other Mars missions have been sent from other nations.

HOW ROCKY PLANETS FORMED

InSight is the first dedicated to unlocking secrets from deep below the Martian surface. The lander will spend 24 months - about one Martian year - using seismic monitoring and underground drilling to gather clues on how Mars formed and, by extension, the origins of Earth and other rocky planets of the inner solar system more than 4 billion years ago.

“What this helps us understand is how we got to here,” said JPL’s Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator, during a pre-landing briefing with reporters last week.

While Earth’s tectonics and other forces have erased most evidence of its early history, much of Mars - about one-third the size of Earth - is believed to have remained largely static over the eons, creating a geologic time machine for scientists.

InSight’s primary instrument is a highly sensitive French-built seismometer, designed to detect the slightest vibrations from “marsquakes” and meteor impacts.

Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes over the course of the mission, producing data to help them deduce the size, density and composition of the planet.

The Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, but they were bolted atop the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.

InSight also is fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat.

Meanwhile, a radio transmitter will send signals back to Earth, tracking Mars’ subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet’s core and possibly whether it remains molten.

The InSight and next rover mission, along with others in the planning stage, are seen as precursors for eventual human exploration of Mars, NASA officials said.",Reuters,0

U.S. stock futures ESc1 tacked on 0.4 percent in Asian trade, on hopes of brisk spending by U.S. consumers on so-called Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales.

Shoppers across the United States snapped up deep discounts on toys, clothing and electronics both online and at stores on Black Friday, giving retailers a strong start to their make-or-break holiday season.

U.S. stock markets had another tough session on Friday, when the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX hit its lowest close in more than six months as the energy sector took a beating in the wake of the oil slump.

The S&P 500 fell 0.66 percent to end about 10.2 percent down from its Sept. 20 closing record high, the second time this year it has entered a 10-percent correction after a rout in early February.

Oil prices were fragile, keeping near their lowest levels since October last year, having dived 8 percent on Friday for the biggest weekly losses in almost three years as rising U.S. production intensified fears of a supply glut.

So far this month, both WTI and Brent futures were down more than 21 percent, on track for their biggest fall since October 2008 unless they recoup some of those losses this week.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 last fetched $50.74 per barrel, up 0.6 percent on the day but still not far from Friday’s low of $50.15.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 last stood at $59.39 per barrel, near Friday’s low of $58.41.

“COLD WAR”

U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold talks on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this month.

Barring any deals there, the U.S. tariffs on $200 billion goods, introduced in late September, are likely to be raised to a proposed 25 percent next year from 10 percent.

“July-September corporate earnings have hardly been affected by the latest tariffs. It’s in the next earnings that we will see the impact. And if the tariffs are raised further next year, earnings will be hit further,” said Mizuho’s Kuramochi.

Some market players say investor worries go well beyond trade issues, noting the decline in global stocks and oil prices began right after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence intensified pressure on China in a speech on Oct. 4.

In that speech, Pence accused China of “malign” efforts to undermine Trump, and Chinese security agencies of masterminding the “wholesale theft of American technology,” including military blueprints.

“Pence’s speech is a start of the cold war,” said a currency trader at a U.S. bank, meaning global supply chains would be put at risk.

“And we have a slowdown in iPhones sales and all that. Bearish factors are piling up,” he said.

Already, the global economy is showing cracks with businesses wary about investment amid the rising headwinds to earning growth.

A survey on Friday showed euro zone business growth has been much weaker than expected this month as slowing global economic momentum and a U.S.-led trade war have led to a sharp fall in exports.

IHS Markit’s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro zone EUPMCF=ECI fell to 52.4 in November, its lowest since late 2014.

That put pressure on the euro. The single currency traded at $1.1335 EUR=, little changed in Asia after a 0.6 percent drop on Friday.

Germany’s 10-year bond yield also fell to 0.331 percent DE10YT=TWEB its lowest since early September.

The British pound hardly moved at $1.2818 GBP= after European Union leaders sealed a Brexit deal on Sunday.

"TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media heaped pressure on Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Monday after her ruling pro-independence party suffered heavy defeats at local elections at the weekend, saying Beijing would seek cooperation with newly elected officials.

Tsai resigned on Saturday as chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after losing key battleground cities in mayoral polls to the China-friendly Kuomintang. The DPP now only controls six cities and counties to the Kuomintang’s 15.

Han Kuo-yu, the Kuomintang’s mayor-elect in the southern port city of Kaohsiung and the most high profile of the party’s winners, said he would open the door to contacts with China.

Beijing has refused to deal with Tsai’s administration since she took office in 2016, accusing her of pushing for the island’s formal independence. That is a red line for China, which considers the proudly democratic island sacred Chinese territory.

Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo with China but will defend Taiwan’s security and democracy.

The official China Daily said in an editorial Tsai had ignored Beijing’s “cooperative stance” and forced relations into a deadlock, and that “her separatist stance has lost her the support of the people on the island”.

“Cross-Straits communication and cooperation between local governments are expected to be strengthened as a result of the election, which will bring more opportunities and help deepen mutual understanding,” it wrote.

The Kuomintang has sent delegations to China since Tsai took office, where they have been warmly received, and that contact is now likely to increase.

Another state-run Chinese paper, the widely read tabloid the Global Times, said in its editorial that the DPP’s “radical thinking” had led them astray.

“The party needs to reflect on this failure and make an about-face on its stance in the cross-Straits ties,” it said.

"MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia seized three Ukrainian naval ships off the coast of Russia-annexed Crimea on Sunday after opening fire on them and wounding several sailors, a move that risks igniting a dangerous new crisis between the two countries.

Russia’s FSB security service said early on Monday its border patrol boats had seized the Ukrainian naval vessels in the Black Sea and used weapons to force them to stop, Russian news agencies reported.

The FSB said it had been forced to act because the ships - two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat - had illegally entered its territorial waters, attempted illegal actions, and ignored warnings to stop while manoeuvring dangerously.

“Weapons were used with the aim of forcibly stopping the Ukrainian warships,” the FSB said in a statement circulated to Russian state media.

“As a result, all three Ukrainian naval vessels were seized in the Russian Federation’s territorial waters in the Black Sea.”

The FSB said three Ukrainian sailors were wounded in the incident and were getting medical care. Their lives were not in danger, it said.

With relations still raw after Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its backing for a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the incident risks pushing the two countries towards a wider conflict.

Ukraine denied its ships had done anything wrong, accused Russia of military aggression, and asked for the international community to mobilise to punish Russia.

The U.N. Security Council will meet on the latest developments at the request of Russia and Ukraine, diplomats said.

POROSHENKO PROPOSES MARTIAL LAW

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko met his top military and security chiefs. Poroshenko said he would propose that parliament impose martial law.

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and then built a giant road bridge linking it to southern Russia that straddles the Kerch Strait - a narrow stretch of water that links the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, which is home to two of Ukraine’s most important ports.

Russia’s control of Crimea, where its Black Sea Fleet is based, and of the bridge mean it is able to control shipping flows.

The crisis began on Sunday after Russia stopped the three Ukrainian ships from entering the Sea of Azov by placing a cargo ship beneath the bridge.

A Reuters witness said Russia backed its blockade with at least two Sukhoi Su-25 warplanes that screeched overhead. Russian state TV said Russian combat helicopters had been deployed in the area.

The Ukrainian navy said on social media six Ukrainian sailors were wounded in the subsequent seizure of its ships, which appear to have been rammed and boarded, and that the Russian attack on them had occurred after they had retreated and headed back towards Odessa, the Black Sea port from where they had begun their journey.

“After leaving the 12-mile zone, the Russian Federation’s FSB (security service) opened fire at the flotilla belonging to ... the armed forces of Ukraine,” it said in a statement.

The European Union said in a statement it expected Russia to restore freedom of passage via the Kerch Strait and urged both sides to act with utmost restraint to de-escalate the situation. A NATO spokeswoman issued a similar appeal to both sides.

RISK OF WIDER CONFLICT

A bilateral treaty gives both Russia and Ukraine the right to use the Sea of Azov, which lies between them and is linked by the narrow Kerch Strait to the Black Sea. Tension has risen since Russia annexed Crimea, with both countries complaining about shipping delays and harassment.

Russia’s border guard service accused Ukraine earlier on Sunday of not informing it in advance of the three ships’ journey, something Kiev denied.

Russia said the Ukrainian ships had been manoeuvring dangerously and ignoring its instructions with the aim of stirring up tensions.

Russian politicians denounced Kiev, saying the incident looked like a calculated bid by Poroshenko to increase his popularity ahead of an election next year.

In another sign of rising tensions, Russia’s state-controlled RIA news agency reported on Sunday night that Ukrainian forces had started heavy shelling of residential areas in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.

"United Technologies (UTC) has completed its $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins and now plans to spin-off its Otis and Carrier units by 2020.

This will see United Technologies comprise engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems - the new unit created through the merger of Rockwell Collins and UTC Aerospace Systems.

The new division supplies avionics, cabin interiors, in-flight WiFi, and flight simulators, among many other electrical, mechanical and software products for the commercial and military aerospace industry.

On a pro-forma basis, the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses had total sales of $39 billion in 2017, UTC says.

Greg Hayes will remain the chief executive officer and chairman of United Technologies following the separation of elevator unit Otis and its building safety and security operations into Carrier.

UTC says the breakup will leave each business better positioned to pursue a “capital allocation strategy more suitable to its respective industry and risk and return profile.” The individual companies will also enjoy greater flexibility with their own stock, as well as management and employee incentives.

The company had been under investor pressure to spin-off those businesses in favor of a company more focused on aerospace.

The proposed separation is expected to be free of US federal income tax for UTC shareholders, the company says. Each spin-off is subject to customary conditions, including final approval by United Technologies' board of directors, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, among other considerations, the firm adds.

UTC projects that, including the acquisition of Rockwell Collins, it will have sales of $64.5 to $65 billion in 2018. The company also expects $500 to $750 million of accretion to free cash flow in 2019 from Rockwell Collins.

UTC announced in September 2017 that it was to acquire Rockwell Collins for $30 billion in cash and shares. The company received approval from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation on 23 November to acquire Rockwell Collins, which was the last regulatory hurdle it needed to clear to complete the acquisition.",Flight Global,0
"FlightGlobal's James Mellon was onboard the final British Airways 767 service to Heathrow

British Airways consigned the Boeing 767 to its history books this week with the retirement of its last two aircraft, concluding almost three decades of service.

The airline’s final scheduled 767-300ER service took place on 25 November, operating as BA663 between Larnaca, Cyprus and London Heathrow. Senior cockpit and cabin crew members staffed the flight leading the farewell celebrations for the twinjet.

Retiring BA 767 Capt Julie Levy (pictured left after final flight) described the aircraft as “a classic workhorse” and raised a toast with all on-board, expressing: “For many of us on-board this is quite an emotional experience, charged with much nostalgia and sentiment. We have grown very fond of this dear Boeing, and she’s become a little bit like a dear old friend.”

The final service, which was fully occupied, was operated by G-BZHA, departing Larnaca at 20:00 local and arriving at Heathrow at 22:25.

G-BZHA operated with BA for 20 years, having been delivered in May 1998, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer. The airline states that this machine alone carried around four million passengers and flew an estimated 23 million miles over nearly 23,000 flights.

The airline’s first -300ER, G-BNWB, was delivered in February 1990, operating its first revenue service to Paris Charles de Gaulle the same month. At its peak, the 28-strong fleet of Rolls-Royce RB211-powered twinjets comprised aircraft configured for both long- and short-haul operations.

As the airline has gradually wound down its 767 fleet, the last remaining examples were part of the “Euro Fleet” featuring 259 seats. Following the end of the 2018 summer season just two examples remained, operating a limited schedule throughout November, predominantly on the BA662/663 rotation to Larnaca.

On 26 November BA’s last two aircraft (G-BZHA and G-BZHB) were ferried from Heathrow to St Athan in Wales for storage and eventual scrapping. According to Fleets Analyzer, 10 of BA’s 767s have been retired to St Athan since August 2016.

BA was launch customer for the RB211-powered 767 in 1987, but only 31 with these engines were built from a total current production run of over 1,100 aircraft. The vast majority of 767s are powered by Pratt Whitney and General Electric engines. BA chose Rolls power to allow for some commonality with its RB211-powered Boeing 747, 757 and Lockheed TriStar fleets.

Unlike other 767s, no R-R-powered aircraft have been retrofitted with winglets or converted into freighters. The differing wing structure and pylons of the R-R version would have required a separate winglet-upgrade supplemental type certificate (STC) to be developed.

Of the 583 Boeing 767-300ERs delivered into passenger service, only 91 aircraft have so far been converted to freighters - 84 GE-powered and seven PW-powered.

Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Flight Ascend Consultancy reasons that “the low population of RR-powered aircraft delivered has acted as a disincentive for anyone to develop an STC and convert the aircraft"".

He adds: “With that said there have only been seven PW-powered aircraft converted, and these low numbers suggest that an STC for R-R could have been economical. Perhaps BA’s strategy to maintain the RB211 parts across their fleet of 747/767s also meant that as aircraft became available for potential conversion, plus their maintenance condition was also a disincentive.”

The final BA 767 flight was flown by G-BZHB on 26 November, from Heathrow to St Athan

Fleets Analyzer shows that five R-R-powered 767s remain in service. The active fleet comprises four ex-BA -336ERs with Eastern Airlines of the USA, while Russian operator Royal Flight operates one of three built for China Yunnan Airlines. This carrier was the only other customer to order the RR-powered 767.

"Authorities in Australia are investigating a flight in which the pilot fell asleep and overflew the destination by 29 miles.

The charter flight took off from Devonport in Tasmania at 6.21am and was due to land at King Island at 7.46am.

The pilot of the twin-engined Piper PA-31 aircraft, which can carry about seven people, was the only person on board and appears to have woken up, flown to the destination - a small island off Tasmania - and landed safely.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it was investigating the flight as a “pilot incapacitation” incident.

“During the cruise, the pilot, who was the only person on board, fell asleep resulting in the aircraft overflying King Island by 46 km [29 miles],” the bureau said.

“As part of the investigation, the ATSB will interview the pilot and review operational procedures.”

It is not clear how the pilot woke up.

Vortex Air, the operator of the flight, said the pilot “unintentionally fell asleep while in command of the aircraft”. It said the flight was the first for the pilot after returning from a period of leave.

“The pilot was the only person on board the aircraft and no one was injured as a result of the incident,” it said.",Telegraph,0
"Delays to the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 programme lie behind the initial restriction of extended twin-engine operations (ETOPS) for the Airbus A330-900.

While approval for 330min ETOPS is being sought for the Trent 7000-powered twinjet, the European Aviation Safety Agency states that the manufacturer has yet to complete particular inspections.

The A330-900 has been cleared for 180min ETOPS but with an engine-use limitation of 500 cycles.

EASA outlines several criteria for “early ETOPS” certification, which permits ETOPS clearance at entry into service of a new aircraft and engine combination.

It requires an approval plan to be submitted to EASA, including a validation test simulating ETOPS service comprising 3,000 full start-stop cycles, from take-off through to landing and reverse thrust, plus three simulated diversions for the ETOPS level sought.

At the end of this test the engine must be visually inspected and then completely disassembled, with the propulsion system hardware examined for airworthiness and any potential sources of in-flight shutdown or loss of thrust control.

Rolls-Royce has “not yet completed” the full engine strip-down and inspection following the 3,000-cycle test, says EASA.

It states that the programme delays have not allowed sufficient time to perform the complete disassembly prior to entry into service.

“The failure to show full compliance from a detailed strip examination at 3,000 cycles life is seen as a reduction in the confidence, which is normally required for full ETOPS approval,” says EASA.

It is granting 180min ETOPS along with the engine-cycle restriction as a mitigation measure.

“This is a conservative approach, restricting usage well within the demonstrated levels, and thereby giving confidence in engine reliability,” says EASA.

But it adds that Rolls-Royce needs to demonstrate full compliance before the end of December, else ETOPS approval will be “withdrawn”.

TAP Portugal took delivery of the first A330-900, the larger of the two A330neo-family variants, during a ceremony in Toulouse on 26 November. The aircraft, MSN1836, is a sister ship to another TAP A330neo, MSN1819, used to conduct route-proving trials earlier this year.

Rolls-Royce says it is aiming to meet the EASA requirements on ETOPS before the year-end deadline.",Flight Global,0
"As Airbus and Boeing make efforts to grow their aftermarket business – particularly through new support activities based on digital services – a key question is: who controls and has access to the data required to develop those services?

The range and volume of technical data that is automatically generated on board aircraft and can provide insight in potential maintenance issues has sharply increased with each new aircraft generation.

Airbus and Boeing have repeatedly said that airlines own the data that is generated during their operations.

However, Airbus has taken a controversial approach with the introduction of its data recording and transmission device FOMAX – short for flight operations and maintenance exchanger – which increases the volume of available parameters on A320-family jets and A330s.

The Rockwell Collins-supplied unit has been designed for both line- and retrofit, and raises the number of available parameters on A320s to 24,000 per flight, from 400.

Under Airbus’s policy, operators will gain access to the increased data range only if they subscribe to, at least, a basic, free service of the airframer’s Skywise digital services platform.

Airbus says that operators are free to use the FOMAX data and pass it on to potential third-party maintenance partners. But nonetheless, the airframer gains access to the anonymised data for fleet-wide analytics, for example, to enable Skywise customers to benchmark their operations against other carriers.

Norman Baker, head of digital at Airbus’s services division, told FlightGlobal at the MRO Europe convention in Amsterdam in October that the manufacturer made a considerable effort to create the Skywise platform where data from, he says, 10-12 sources – including the aircraft, airline operations, OEMs, maintenance providers, spare part inventories and logistic providers – can be aggregated and harmonised in a coherent and usable format.

“We invested a lot in the ability to process this data, in the ability to bring it to a position where it can be analysed and used to create value… This is not something to be taken lightly,” says Baker – adding: “It is not taking your [the airline’s] data and selling it back to you.”

For Lufthansa Technik chief executive Johannes Bussmann, however, the idea of airlines having to subscribe to Skywise and then having to share data with Airbus in order to gain access to the FOMAX information is not acceptable.

In his view, the manufacturer’s position is a matter of “market abuse”.

Bussmann tells FlightGlobal: “The [FOMAX] data belongs to the airlines, without encryption… And then the airlines decide what to do with it. Obviously, Airbus can have it too, there is no question about it. But they have no right to exclusively claim that data [via Skywise].”

He argues: “It is important that everyone, who can add value to it, can have access to the data.”

LHT launched its digital services platform, Aviatar, in 2017 – the same year when Airbus and Boeing established their respective Skywise and AnalytX portals.

NEUTRAL PLATFORM

The German maintenance, repair and overhaul group intends to spin out Aviatar as standalone business in the short term and share its ownership with other aftermarket players – including competitors – in order to establish a “neutral” system for operators and service providers to access and analyse aircraft onboard data.

Detailed talks are under way with several MRO providers and, Bussmann says, LHT is open to discuss potential participation with select equipment manufacturers too.

He says Aviatar’s objective is not to establish a non-OEM competitor to Skywise and AnalytX that is ultimately controlled by a single party in LHT. “We would just replace one monopoly with another: that makes no sense,” he says.

Instead, the non-OEM system is to become an “open platform” for data tools and services from different, potentially competing specialists, which would provide operators with “free” access to their aircraft data.

Air France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance vice-president digital and innovation Rodolphe Parisot welcomes LHT’s initiative.

“Hopefully it will have an impact on competition on the market,” he says.

Parisot confirms that AFI KLM E&M is evaluating options to address the topic, including the possibility of establishing an own-digital-services platform, and is in talks with potential partners, he says.

“We don’t believe in models where only one single entity owns a platform which is… for a global industry.”

He says: “For us, a platform has to be neutral, open to competitors, and it should… respect data ownership of all users.”

INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS

Parisot notes that an own platform is not necessary to develop digital services.

AFI KLM E&M has developed a range of predictive maintenance solutions for specific components, as have other aftermarket players.

The analytics are based on data routinely downloaded from aircraft – for example, via the quick-access recorder – and the solutions have been made available to third-party customers.

Airbus says it intends to partner with airlines and aftermarket specialists in order to jointly develop applications for Skywise, which the airframer also describes as an “open” platform.

Despite the possibility of developing individual solutions, Parisot says that having access to a platform is important as it represents a “key business channel” to sell services and compete with other specialists – a marketplace “where you can do business from many to many [parties]”.

But more importantly, digital service platforms are set to become central for the planning and management of aircraft support services in future, as maintenance events will be determined by data analytics rather than predefined inspection schedules.

Parisot believes that “many” airlines – especially carriers with in-house engineering capabilities – and smaller OEMs are “not at ease” with the prospect of having to rely for their equipment’s maintenance on platforms controlled by Airbus or Boeing.

However, Delta Air Lines – a legacy airline with long-standing in-house maintenance capabilities and a third-party MRO business – was revealed in October as the 29th Skywise customer.

Airbus foresees that, until the end of 2019, the number of Skywise customers and aircraft under contract will treble to 100 and 10,000, respectively.

Christophe Bernardini – previously chief executive of Zodiac Aerospace’s cabin branch and MRO specialist Sabena Technics – confirms to FlightGlobal that aircraft equipment suppliers view the airframers’ aftermarket efforts with concern.

As aftersales revenue is “at the heart” of suppliers’ business models, he says that “strategies will have to evolve, knowing that [airframers] will have the power in negotiations of new programmes”.

ENSURING ACESS

Noting that access to operational data is “clearly… a key factor of success in the aftermarket segment”, he says that equipment suppliers “must develop strategies to get that data”.

He adds that operators have a “role to play” as it will be “in their interest that these data [sets] are available to all the players” in order to create competition for solutions.

Baker describes questions around data ownership as a “tangential” issue while airlines are, in his view, interested in a “common source of truth” – data from multiple sources, readily available for analytics according to airlines’ objectives.

He insists: “The airlines have control and ownership of their data, they can choose whether to share or not… We have created a great ecosystem for them to provide their data into and get much greater value for.”

Mike Fleming, vice president of commercial services for Boeing Global Services, takes a similar stance.

“Ownership of data without being able to turn it into something valuable… is not a good place to be in,” he said at the MRO Europe convention.

“The more relevant aspect to it is: who is best positioned to turn that data into knowledge?” he asks.

Fleming argues that Boeing’s domain knowledge is key in the design of analytical tools and that it is “not very efficient” for airlines to individually prepare huge data volumes and devise algorithms.

“Anybody can hire a mathematician to do a statistical analysis on data coming off the airplane,” says Fleming – adding: “The key is having to make knowledge what it is that you are looking for… which makes the big difference on the airplane”.

Fleming asserts that Boeing does not control the data, and that all operational data used for analytics is being supplied by operators: “We don’t have access to their data, unless they allow us.

“If the airline wants to provide their data to a particular MRO or an OEM… that’s up to the airline’s choice,” he says.

FlightGlobal understands, however, that Boeing’s supply of digital services and tools – for example, the airframer has introduced a set of “Self-Service Analytics” – is linked to an authorisation for the manufacturer to use its customers’ data for fleet-wide analytics.

THIRD-PARTY MAINTENANCE PROVIDERS

Bussmann thinks it feasible that in the long term, only Airbus and Boeing’s platforms plus Aviatar and a potential fourth system will be available on the market to access and analyse data from the entire aircraft.

Engine data might be handled differently as powerplant manufacturers have established separate data management systems.

This raises a question over what role third-party maintenance providers will play – especially independent companies that have no access to digital platforms.

Bussmann foresees that unless neutral platforms exist for all industry players to access aircraft data and analytical tools, some MRO specialists will have no choice but to join manufacturers’ aftermarket initiatives and thus are likely become “mere labour providers”.

“They are not solution partners, but are effectively told on a task card what and what not to do. With that, it is not possible to lead a business in a meaningful manner and invest in its development,” he says.

MRO facilities generate valuable data in their own right, when they disassemble equipment to determine sources for malfunctions or performance degradations.

That information is especially relevant for manufacturers as it can help develop further equipment generations and modifications.

But a question is what MRO providers will gain from manufacturers in return for the submission of the repair insights.

As the manufacturers do not intend to complete aircraft or component maintenance in-house, they have established partnerships – in some cases with equity investments – with external MRO providers.

Airbus has established an “MRO Alliance” with a select group of service providers and beyond that, Baker says, the airframer is “exploring models of how we leverage Skywise together with MROs”.

He acknowledges that the airframers’ increased aftermarket activity and digitisation will be factors in an MRO sector consolidation, and that the manufacturers will play a central role in shaping that future market.

“I would encourage the third-party MROs to create as much value as possible for the customers and to come to us with ideas of how we can work together,” he says.

He adds: “Digital is going to change that landscape… The market will make the determination about who will succeed [and] who won’t.”

The digitisation is one among several factors putting MRO providers under pressure.

Developing repair capabilities for new-generation aircraft has become harder as equipment has become more durable, while manufacturers guard their intellectual property more closely than in the past.

All parties interviewed for this article note a trend among airlines to source their maintenance requirements in fewer, more comprehensive hour-based MRO deals in order to reduce management efforts of handling a multitude of suppliers.

WITHOUT COMPETITION

That trend plays into the hands of the airframers and engine manufacturers as they are in a position to wrap up long-term aftermarket support agreements as part of equipment sales – without third-party MRO competition.

Bussmann warns if operational data is exclusively channelled to manufacturers under such agreements and is not freely available when the contracts expire, it will become difficult for third-party maintenance specialists to service equipment – and for operators to stimulate competition for follow-up MRO deals.

Operators may be in a strong negotiation position versus manufacturers during initial aircraft acquisitions. But having such a position when maintenance contracts are being negotiated at a later point in the aircraft’s lifecycle will arguably depend on MRO competition.

“If there is no possibility to provide operational data to others, then [airlines] will become dependent on a sole supplier from the aircraft’s acquisition until the end of its service life,” Bussmann says.

Meanwhile, LHT is evaluating development of an aircraft data aggregation unit – similar to FOMAX – to ensure access to operational information without the airframers’ involvement.

Bussmann says: “We can build such a box too, that’s no great feat… and we will do it if we can’t reach a sensible agreement. We have started with the development.”",Flight Global,1

"The Indonesian authorities have concluded that the Lion Air plane that crashed last month killing 189 people was not fit to fly and should have been grounded after recurring technical problems.

The Boeing 737 MAX vanished from radar about 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on October 29, slamming into the Java Sea at 450 miles per hour moments after the pilot had asked to return to the airport.

Data from the jetliner, presented in preliminary findings by accident investigators on Wednesday, showed the pilots fought to prevent the crash from the moment the plane took off as the 737’s nose was repeatedly forced down, apparently by an automatic system receiving incorrect sensor readings.

The information from the flight data recorder reveals that the crews successfully battled to raise the nose over two dozen times before finally losing control.

The National Transport Safety Committee (KNKT) did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, with a final crash report not likely to be filed until next year.

However, it admonished Lion Air, the nation’s largest budget carrier, for repeatedly putting the plane back into service despite failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator in the days leading up to the fatal flight.",Telegraph,0
"Bombardier will pitch to play a key role in a future Airbus composite wing programme, believing its expertise in designing and building the innovative carbonfibre wing for the A220 gives it the edge over the European manufacturer’s own factories.

“We have been very clear – this is an opportunity we need to grab,” says Michael Ryan, chief operating officer at Bombardier Aerostructures & Engineering Services (BAES), and head of the company’s Belfast plant, which builds the A220 wing. The Northern Ireland facility has been pioneering composite technologies since it was Shorts Aerospace in the 1980s.

Airbus took control of the troubled CSeries programme in July, renaming it the A220, and effectively allowing Bombardier to exit from a cripplingly loss-making commitment. However, the Canadian company retained the intellectual property rights on the wing, which BAES in Belfast continues to build for Airbus as a supplier.

The Belfast operation, together with Airbus’s own wing operations at Broughton and Filton, remain crucial to government efforts to keep wing production in the UK following Brexit. France, Germany, and Spain have long harboured ambitions to snatch responsibility for wing design once Airbus begins serious work on its next generation of aircraft, given the importance of the technology for industry.

Noting that Bombardier is the first outside company to build wings for an Airbus airliner, Ryan says: “If an opportunity comes on a new wing, Airbus would have to decide: ‘Do we do it in-house or go to a third-party provider?’ We would want to be a part of that, making a pitch to be involved in a new wing.”

Ryan was speaking to journalists earlier today at a Bombardier media luncheon, after returning from a visit to Toulouse.

Bombardier in Belfast was a supplier to Airbus long before the CSeries acquisition, building, among other items, nacelles for International Aero Engines V2500-powered A320 family aircraft, as well as Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered A320neos.

"Airbus has spent €15 million preparing the company for the possibility that the UK could exit the European Union without a post-withdrawal agreement in place.

The airframer’s UK senior vice-president, Katherine Bennett, disclosed the figure during an appearance before a cross-party parliamentary industrial strategy committee on 28 November.

She told the committee that the company had to “prepare for the worst”, adding that it had twice written to its suppliers over the past year explaining its preparations for a “no-deal” scenario.

Bennett added that Airbus had encouraged all suppliers needing European Aviation Safety Agency certification to apply for third-party status.

But she stressed that Airbus was encouraged by the greater certainty created by the provisional UK-EU withdrawal agreement. The agreement has yet to be approved by the UK parliament, and faces the strong possibility of being rejected.

Bennett said that Airbus had entered a “holding pattern” and had suspended any significant new investment in the UK while the uncertainty over ‘Brexit’ persisted.

“If the withdrawal agreement is successful Airbus would consider continuing to invest, as the company has done over many years,” she said. Bennett declined to quantify the investment which had been put on hold.

She described the draft agreement as a “welcome first step”, adding: “Our concerns were about certainty and lack of clarity.

“We can see a lot of benefits in the agreement, but we’re still looking at it in more detail. Some of the customs issues are quite complicated.”

Bennett emphasised that Airbus is “not happy with Brexit at all” and reiterated the company’s position, outlined in a risk assessment earlier this year, that a “chaotic” withdrawal, without an agreement, would lead the company to reconsider future investment in the UK.

“We want the lightest touch in terms of checks at customs,” she told the committee. “We want the dial to be as low as possible in terms of any extra burdens.”

Airbus has a “huge task force” examining the customs situation, said Bennett, pointing out that the company was ramping up its wing production for single-aisle aircraft.

“We’re concerned that, if there’s disruption at the borders, it will potentially cause an impact on our being able to deliver the wings, to go to our final assembly, then deliver to airlines,” she said.

Bennett revealed that Airbus had spent €15 million on “no deal” preparations, such as warehousing to stockpile parts, adding: “I’d much rather that money had been spent on research and technology, or more skills.”

She also told the committee that Airbus was serious about reviewing UK investment, and the possibility of moving production elsewhere – even if it was “not going to move overnight”.

“No-deal Brexit is absolutely what we don’t want,” she added, stating that the withdrawal agreement negotiated, while “not a perfect deal”, was “much better than no deal” – and that prolonging uncertainty would lead to more business investment decisions, in general, going against the UK.",Flight Global,0
"It has been 14 months in the making thanks to a tortuous regulatory approvals process, but United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTAS) and Rockwell Collins have finally completed their $30 billion merger.

Now branded as Collins Aerospace, the division is one of two – Pratt & Whitney being the other – within a reshaped United Technologies, the parent company having announced a spin-off of its climate control and elevators businesses as the deal closed.

Collins Aerospace is led by Kelly Ortberg, the former chief executive of Rockwell Collins, with ex-UTAS boss Dave Gitlin as president and chief operating officer.

Speaking to FlightGlobal on 27 November – ""day one"" for the new business – Ortberg described the moment as a ""monumental day for the industry"".

There's a degree of management hyperbole in that statement, but the merger does create an aerospace juggernaut: based on 2017 figures, combined revenues were $21 billion and the group has 70,000 employees globally across 300 sites. It has six business units – aerostructures, avionics, interiors, mechanical systems, mission systems, and power and controls – which offer a nose-to-tail basket of aerospace products.

Crucially, the business has a presence on virtually every current and next-generation commercial and military platform and a number one or two position in a variety of segments.

Despite the lengthy approval process, Ortberg was never worried that the competition authorities would prevent the merger.

""I never really thought that it wouldn't happen – but you never know when,"" he says, attributing the slow pace to the pair's ""large, complicated portfolio"".

Although certain divestments were required by competition regulators, the loss of the operations carved out as part of that process does not fundamentally alter the rationale for the merger in the first place.

""I would say that the beauty [of the merger] is that we are combining from a position of strength,"" says Gitlin.

""Looking at both our portfolios, I feel very positive about the union we are planning.""

Certainly, the breadth of programme penetration is impressive: Ortberg reels off a list of new or in-development commercial aircraft on which the combined business has a significant presence – the Airbus A220 and A320neo, Boeing's 737 Max and 777X, the Embraer E-Jet E2 series and so on – then repeats the process for the military, rotary-wing and business jet segments too.

""It is really a broad portfolio offering for everything that flies,"" he says.

That presence will be crucial for Collins Aerospace to leverage as it marries the aircraft ""infrastructure"" that both businesses already provide with the air-to-ground and ground networks from the Rockwell Collins side of the operation.

Much has been made of the potential cost and efficiency benefits aviation can take from the digital revolution, whether that is termed the internet of things, or the connected or smart aircraft.

But for Ortberg, what that means is simple: it is about ""getting the right information at the right time to the right person so they can make the right decision"".

""We are in a unique position to deliver that,"" he says. ""Our challenge is to move that information off the platform on a real-time basis so that it can be leveraged.""

Whether the end output is the holy grail of predictive maintenance across the whole aircraft or addressing a component-level issue, Gitlin believes the new business is ideally, if not uniquely, placed to provide the tools for airlines or OEMs to achieve those goals.

""Everybody is looking to optimise these very expensive assets and be more efficient,"" says Ortberg. ""We are earning our way into the market by delivering this capability at a lower cost than it is currently being done.""

Although both repeatedly refer to solutions and systems as key future offerings, both are equally at pains to stress that continuing to provide the hardware in the first place is vital.

With digital ""a trend that's here to stay"", as Gitlin puts it, Collins Aerospace ""is designing the base hardware to take advantage of that – we are designing for digital"". That means having the right sensors and algorithms at component level to dovetail with future prognostic and analytical software.

Boeing and other OEMs have made no secret of their desire to capture a bigger slice of the aftermarket – as well as driving down supplier rates. As a result, many view the merger of UTAS and Rockwell Collins as a means of combating that move – or, in Ortberg's words, ""bulking up to compete"".

A bigger company will be harder to push around, of course, but Ortberg denies that was ever the reason for the merger: ""Our focus is on combining these entities to deliver more value to our customers,"" he says.

""We have to figure out how to structure ourselves to deliver best value going forward.""",Flight Global,0
"UK prime minister Theresa May says the final structure of the country’s relationship with the European Aviation Safety Agency is still to be negotiated, but that it would still press for membership.

May had previously suggested, in a speech in March, that the UK could pursue associate membership of the agency following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.

But a parliamentary cross-party liaison committee questioned May on 29 November over the absence of a reference to EASA membership in the provisional withdrawal agreement.

"Monarch Aircraft Engineering (MAEL) has clarified its relationship with Petrol Jersey Limited, a Channel Island-based entity that apparently acquired the MRO provider for just £1 ($1.27).

In addition, the Luton Airport-headquartered operation has agreed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with its creditors in order to restructure debt repayments.

KPMG, which is handling the insolvency of former sister business Monarch Airlines, indicated in its most recent update into the administration that Petrol Jersey had purchased MAEL from another entity within the group, Monarch 2011.

However, due to company law on the Channel Island, little detail is available on Petrol Jersey: its most recent annual return, filed in February this year, indicates that the firm's shareholders are other trusts or holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, Jersey and Luxembourg.

Only two individuals are listed on the return – Douglas Silverman and Jay Bharadwa – both of whom have links with New York hedge fund Senator Investment Group.

MAEL describes Petrol Jersey as ""one of the investment vehicles of Greybull Capital"".

Greybull Capital was the former owner of Monarch Airlines and has, since late October, been the ""substantial majority shareholder in MAEL"", says the UK maintenance firm.

In addition, Greybull Capital made a ""substantial capital injection into MAEL"", when it became majority owner, says the maintenance firm.

MAEL declines to comment on the identity of any other shareholders.

As part of the recapitalisation process, Petrol Jersey now has a secured charge over MAEL's property portfolio.

""The loan is part of the financial arrangements that were made when the new ownership and capital injection were finalised in late October, and mirror financial arrangements that MAEL had in place previously,"" its states.

Petrol Jersey is the senior secured creditor in the Monarch Airlines administration; it has so far received a total of £60 million realised by the insolvency process, including £5 million from Monarch Holidays.

In its progress report, KPMG says that MAEL has proposed a CVA to its creditors. MAEL says that has now ""been approved"" and ""enables the business to move forward with confidence, and to fully realise its potential as a leading, independent aircraft maintenance provider with a strong customer base and a skilled, dedicated workforce.""",Flight Global,0
"Senior representatives of the UK aerospace industry, including Airbus, appear provisionally content with the country’s proposed relationship with the European Aviation Safety Agency following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union.

The framework withdrawal agreement, which outlines the post-Brexit relationship, states simply that the two sides will “explore the possibility of co-operation” between UK authorities and agencies including EASA.

“In this context, the UK will consider aligning with [European] Union rules in relevant areas,” it adds.

It says the UK and EU should strive to maintain “high standards” of aviation safety and security, including through “close co-operation” between EASA and the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority.

While UK prime minister Theresa May had mentioned the possibility of associate EASA membership, during a speech in March, the framework agreement appears to stop short of such an arrangement.

But a cross-party parliamentary committee on industrial strategy heard on 28 November that the UK could still potentially have influence within EASA despite a lack of formal membership.

Paul Everitt, chief executive of aerospace trade organisation ADS, told the committee that most of the “detailed work” within EASA is carried out by working groups.

“We’d always prefer a seat for the government at the table – it gives us extra reassurance that there’s always going to be someone in the room pulling for you,” he said.

But he added that the organisation was “comfortable” with the withdrawal agreement, and its reference to EASA, which gave “sufficient confidence” regarding a continuing relationship.

“Again, it’s not what it is today,” he stressed. “But it will minimise disruption as we go forward.”

Royal Aeronautical Society president Simon Henley echoed Everitt’s point about needing to ensure that the UK had involvement in the working groups, highlighting that the UK might only be invited to sit at “particular tables” to discuss matters of “direct interest” to the country.

“It’s not necessarily automatic,” he told the committee.

Airbus UK senior vice-president Katherine Bennett stated that the company was “comfortable that the process is going to work, at the moment”.

“It’s not ideal not to have a place at the top table,” she said. But she said that Airbus’s priority, in relation to EASA, was focused on delivering aircraft to customers, and she pointed out that Airbus has a strong “footprint representation” within other EU member states.

"Monarch Aircraft Engineering (MAEL) has terminated the provision of maintenance services to Flybe, which has been a key customer for a number of years.

Flybe says that MAEL, which has recently been through an ownership restructuring, “unilaterally and in conflict with our contract” withdrew its services on 23 November.

The UK regional carrier has been a customer for line maintenance and overnight checks on Bombardier Q400 turboprops and Embraer E-Jets at MAEL’s Birmingham hangar, since the purpose-built facility was opened in 2013. Additionally, the contract covered line maintenance services at Manchester airport.

Flybe says it is “very disappointed” about the move, which, it adds, “[appears] to have been undertaken without due consideration of our business, customers and operations, and with no legal justification”.

The airline says it has been “wholly supportive” throughout MAEL’s “complex restructuring” process, which led to the agreement of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with the MRO provider’s creditors.

Flybe has, meanwhile, conducted all maintenance requirements with its own staff and contracted service providers, “without any adverse impact” on its operations, it says.

The airline adds that it is “sympathetic to the many employees of MAEL who may be affected by the loss of work”, and that it will offer job opportunities for engineers in Birmingham and Manchester.

Earlier this month, Flybe disclosed that it is considering a sale of its business, with Virgin Atlantic considering an offer for the Exeter-based carrier.

MAEL says: “Due to circumstances we cannot disclose, we decided to suspend repair and maintenance operations for Flybe on 23 November.”

It asserts that the new service will provide lessors with ""unique improvements in terms of greater visibility, accessibility, portability and liquidity"".

Lessors will gain more flexibility by being able to withdraw from engine life refurbishment activities – under an operator's TotalCare package – at ""any time that the aircraft is off lease"", R-R says.

Under the new scheme, lessors will additionally have visibility of operators' TotalCare rates for refurbishment activities for engines aged five years or above, from service entry.

"Airbus has sought authorisation to install ‘mini-suite’ seats on A330-900s to be delivered to a US operator, as part of a 281-seat configuration.

While the operator is not identified in the filing to the US FAA, Delta Air Lines is the only US carrier with A330-900s on order.

Airbus says the cabin interior proposed for the operator features a three-class layout comprising 29 business-class, 28 premium-economy, and 224 economy seats.

It states that the business-class cabin would entirely comprise mini-suites, characterised by a seat with surrounding furniture “intended to provide privacy” to the occupant.

Airbus says that this would be achieved typically with a sliding door.

The proposed configuration, notably the door mechanism, is not compliant with standard regulations, and the filing seeks an exemption to permit the installation of the suites.

Airbus points out that it has already installed mini-suites on its A321, A340, A350 and A380 models in Europe, while Boeing has similar fittings on 777s. It adds that similar designs, such as that for Delta’s A350s, have secured exemptions.

“The design of the mini-suites which will be installed on this A330 is in line with the previously-certified ones,” it adds.

“They are not creating a completely isolated compartment for occupants, as the sliding doors have a partial height.”

Design precautions, it adds, ensure that the occupant can exit the mini-suite in all conditions. The filing has been newly disclosed for public comment.

Delta is the only US operator with outstanding A330 orders, for a total of 35 A330neos – all A330-900s – following a supplemental agreement reached in November. Deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to commence in 2019.",Flight Global,0

"It was perhaps no surprise that the first day of FlightGlobal’s Aerospace Big Data Europe conference ended with a lively debate on the contentious issue of who owns and controls access to an aircraft's technical data.

Airbus warned that the discussion could distract existing aftermarket players from seizing commercial opportunities that the large-scale introduction of predictive maintenance practices could bring.

Matthew Evans, business architect and head of data analytics for Airbus’s Skywise digital services platform, said at the event in London on 28 November, that the move towards data analytics in aircraft support represented a “great opportunity” for IT specialists to enter the MRO market.

He warns that if the sector becomes “caught up” in the data ownership debate, aftermarket maintenance providers could be overtaken by the likes of Amazon, Google and IBM.

Airbus has been criticised for the introduction of its FOMAX data aggregation device – or flight operations and maintenance exchanger – which increases the volume of available data on A320-family jets and A330s, because operators will only gain access to the information if they also subscribe to Skywise.

Lufthansa Group senior director analytics and data solutions Jan Stoevesand says that the prospect of having to hand over operational aircraft data to an external agency – without the airline first having the option of accessing the data in its own IT system – represents a “big problem” for the German carrier.

Stoevesand says that airlines must be able to download, decrypt and access their data; that airlines must have a choice of service providers to analyse the information and make recommendations; and that competition should exist between digital service providers.

He argues that the acquisition and storage of aircraft data should be separated by a “Chinese wall” from the analysis and usage of that information.

Stoevesand agrees with a suggestion by SITA OnAir head of e-aircraft strategy and marketing Pierre-Yves Benain that the existing Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) could provide a model for the transmission of aircraft data.

ACARS messages are principally transmitted via either SITA or Arinc systems to operators.

While Evans acknowledges that ACARS provides a “good model”, he claims the system is “not a model that evolves quickly”, and that it is not suitable for handling the large volumes of data generated by modern aircraft.

Rolls-Royce head of product management Nick Ward responds that while ACARS message content has changed over the years, the channel has remained the same.

He suggests that the ACARS model could continue to be employed for modern aircraft data transmission.

Ward questioned, however, whether a situation where “all data is [available] out there” could potentially lead to “misinterpretation” of the information.

Noting the technical issues that have developed on Trent 1000 engines over recent years, he says that he would not want airlines to form an “opinion” about potential issues even if these carriers are not affected.

He thinks that the reason why airlines freely provide engine data to R-R is because the manufacturer will “guarantee an outcome”, such as fixed maintenance costs. Nevertheless, he believes that as a “industry as a whole, we have to learn about diversification”.

He says: “I don’t see a world where one party has the only ability to provide predictive maintenance on an aircraft.”

Evans called for collaboration between manufacturers and maintenance providers as a priority for 2019.

“As an aircraft manufacturer, let’s not stand behind locking the aircraft data. As an MRO, let’s not stand behind locking the maintenance and reliability data of the airlines. Let’s figure out how to work together. Let’s figure how to work with start-ups and others that have good ideas. And let’s move forward,” he says.",Flight Global,0
"What do a pair of seating manufacturers, four light aircraft manufacturers, an aerostructures specialist, and one of Europe's top maintenance, repair and overhaul houses have in common? They are among around a dozen Western aerospace companies that now effectively have the name of a Chinese owner over the door.

China – the biggest emerging market for commercial aviation products and services – has been busily creating its own indigenous industry over the past 20 years, attracting investment from Airbus, Boeing, Embraer and others. However, at the same time, money has been flowing the other way in arguably even greater amounts, creating a mini Chinese aerospace empire in the USA and Europe.

Earlier this decade, Chinese entities bought US GA brands Cirrus Aviation, Enstrom Helicopter, and Mooney. In the past two years, the focus has switched to Europe, with Austria's Diamond Aircraft, Gardner Aerospace of the UK, and Switzerland's SR Technics all coming under Chinese control, together with UK cabin interiors specialists Acro, AIM Altitude, and Thompson Aero Seating.

The background to each of the acquisitions differs. Most of the Western firms have been family-owned or backed by equity holders keen to exit at a profit. The Chinese investors range from private entrepreneurs to state-backed conglomerates making strategic additions to their portfolios.

Their game plans differ too. In some acquisitions, the strategy has involved replicating in China the company's successful production model, bringing assembly closer to local manufacturers and maintenance providers, while giving the business access to lower-cost labour. In other instances, investors have funded expansion at home, or appear content to let the business motor along more or less as before.

For Derby-based Gardner, mining group Shaanxi Ligeance Mineral Resources has ticked the first two boxes. Soon after its £326 million ($431 million) acquisition by SLMR in June 2017, Gardner began work on a 42,000m2 (450,000ft2) factory in Chengdu – a ""cut and paste"" of its UK operation. This July, funds from SLMR helped Gardner buy another UK company, Northern Aerospace, which specialises in large machined aerostructures.

REVENUE BOOST

The addition of the County Durham-based firm takes Gardner's revenues to more than $300 million, and ""broadens our portfolio"", with new product lines and customers, including Embraer, Gulfstream, Pilatus, and Ruag, says business development executive vice-president Nick Guttridge. The two also share Airbus as a customer, and the airframer has been ""very encouraging"" about the coming together of the two businesses, he says.

Together with the Chinese factory, the acquisition will also push Gardner towards its ambition of becoming a $1 billion-turnover concern by 2022. ""That was always going to involve diversification by territory and into new sectors, particularly engine components and other equipment,"" says Guttridge. ""We were never going to do it only organically.""

A more recent swoop has seen a rising star of the airliner interiors market come under Chinese control. Early this year, Zhejiang Science and Technology Investment (ZTC), a manufacturer of seats for trucks and construction vehicles, acquired Acro Aircraft Seating, a decade-old start-up, for £55 million, a move the London Gatwick-based company says will ""accelerate [its] access to the Chinese market"".

Acro – which made its name in the retrofit market and was added recently to the Airbus buyer-furnished equipment, or line-fit, catalogue – intends to open a second production site in Shanghai next year, exploiting ZTC's ""connections"" to win deals with Chinese and other Asian airlines. In ""due course"", it plans a third assembly line in the USA.

The acquisition gave ZTC a ""ready-made aircraft seat division"", says Acro's senior vice-president sales, Alan McInnes, part of a management team that is staying in place. As well as providing an inroad to China, the new owner will allow Acro to invest in the necessary research and development and production to realise some of its ambitions, including a move into the widebody market, he says.

""We need a committed and long-term shareholder to provide the millions we need to invest in R&D and develop at least one new product a year for the next five years,"" says McInnes. ""The fact that our new owner is Chinese is not important. What is important is that we now have a shareholder that recognises the potential of the aviation market.""

The Shanghai factory will come at a time when demand for cabin refurbishments is growing in China, as aircraft acquired in the early years of the industry boom move onto the secondary market, says McInnes, who believes that the country's retrofit market will be ""equivalent to the factory-fit market there today"" within three years. ""We want to be ready.""

STAYING PUT

While the Chinese site will bring Acro closer to those end-customers, there is no prospect of it moving its main assembly and design centre from the UK. ""It’s just not on the agenda,"" says McInnes. ""We have made commitments to Airbus that we will remain close to Hamburg and Toulouse. The Chinese factory will provide additional capacity to meet their needs, as their single-aisle fleet in particular expands.""

Another Chinese name better known in the aviation world has also been expanding its footprint in the cabin interiors market. Two years after buying Bournemouth-based premium cabin monuments specialist AIM Altitude and Northern Ireland's Thompson Aero Seating, AVIC announced at July's Farnborough air show that it is merging them into a new unit called AVIC Cabin Systems.

The division will also include a Chinese seat-maker and cabin fixtures manufacturer FACC of Austria, which AVIC has owned for almost a decade. According to Richard Bower, chief executive of AIM Altitude, the combined entity will allow the companies to merge their capabilities.

Although each business will remain independent, there will be ""some co-ordination"" in terms of research and development and customer marketing. ""We are already working closely with Thompson Aero Seating to provide front-row monuments that integrate seamlessly with the seating,"" he says. The first fruit of that co-operation was unveiled at April's AIX show at Hamburg, where the two companies had a joint stand.

AIM Altitude's acquisition by AVIC ""changed our business"", insists Bower. ""Now, for the first time, we are owned by a strategic shareholder with a long-term vision. The shape of the business will change."" However, he agrees with McInnes that this is unlikely to involve moving production to China. ""Cabin interiors are not the products to do that, they are highly bespoke and high value. It's not a commodity industry,"" he says.

Perhaps the most significant Chinese acquisition of the past 12 months has been the sale of a majority stake in Diamond Aircraft of Austria – a business that includes a sister company in Canada and the Austro engine manufacturer – to Wanfeng Aviation by founder Christian Dries. Dries described Diamond – a small business that he bought in the early 1990s and turned into one of the world's biggest producers of training aircraft – as ""my life’s work"".

New chief executive Frank Zhang says Wanfeng did not ""buy Diamond simply as an investment opportunity"" but because it could develop the company into ""the leading brand and producer of fixed-wing light aircraft in the general and business aviation market, but also in the fields of special mission"".

Interestingly, Diamond’s strategy under Dries had been for the past few years to move steadily into the higher-margin special missions market, and away from the more price-sensitive flying school sector. Israel's Aeronautics, for instance, uses Diamond's DA42 platform as the platform for its Dominator unmanned surveillance air vehicle. At the Farnborough air show, Diamond debuted the latest version of its aerobatic trainer, the Dart 550.

Having a Chinese company owning a manufacturer of aircraft marketed to military customers has not met with any objections from the Austrian or Canadian governments, insists Wanfeng. ""Since the takeover, we have not experienced one single situation reflecting to the new ownership and can say that there is no impact on any business of Diamond,"" it says. All research and development activities will remain in Austria.

US AMBITIONS

Earlier this decade, Chinese investors made a move for two US GA names: piston aircraft manufacturer Mooney, and helicopter firm Enstrom. Since coming under the ownership of Meijing Group in 2013, Texas-based Mooney, which had been in bankruptcy protection since 2008, has been working on a second aircraft design, called the M10, and has discussed adding a production line in China's Henan province. However, since July 2017, the company has not provided any updates on the project.

Chongqing Helicopter Investment bought Michigan-based Enstrom Helicopter, a manufacturer of two piston models, the F28F and 280FX, and the turbine-powered 480B, in late 2012, with the intention of helping it push into the Asian market with fresh capital. At the time, president Jerry Mullins described it as a ""major step in moving Enstrom to a new level"". The company expanded its production site in 2014 and is developing a fourth model – the TH180 trainer – with certification expected next year.

However, the biggest prize in the GA world has arguably been Cirrus, which was acquired by AVIC subsidiary CAIGA in 2011. Since then, the Minnesota-based company has seen its fortunes soar. Last year marked the fourth in succession that Cirrus delivered more than 300 SR Series aircraft. It has built a training centre in Tennessee and added 300 staff. In 2016, its Vision Jet, the only single-engined personal jet on the market, was certificated, and earlier this year the aircraft won the prestigious Collier Trophy.

CAIGA’s takeover of Cirrus was controversial. Already the world's biggest manufacturer of piston aircraft, many opposed an icon of US aviation coming under Chinese control, although attempts to block the takeover foundered. Cirrus's success since 2011 appears to have endorsed then president Brent Wouters’ dismissal of ""anti-Chinese sentiment"" and promise that the purchase was a ""terrific opportunity for Cirrus to grow around the world and strengthen its balance sheet"".

Back in Europe, SR Technics has gone through several owners since being spun off from former flag-carrier Swissair in the 1990s. In 2016, sole shareholder Mubadala – the Abu Dhabi sovereign investment house – sold an 80% stake to China's HNA Group, a conglomerate that owns Hainan Airlines. The Chinese company has promised to support the long-term strategy of the MRO provider, which has included opening lower-cost facilities in Serbia, Malaysia and Malta.

China's interests have even extended to supersonic jet developments. In April, an online travel agency, Ctrip, took a stake in Boom, one of several start-ups planning passenger aircraft capable of supersonic flight and which has won order commitments from Virgin Group and Japan Airlines. Ctrip predicts high demand for ""the travel of tomorrow"" in the Chinese market. The tie-up will see the Chinese company secure up to 15 seats on one of Boom's first commercial flights.

Chinese money has helped small and mid-sized European and US aviation companies realise aspirations that would have been unrealistic had they had to seek capital from private investors or banks in the West. The industry's record of failed projects has made financiers very wary, and even companies with a strong track record of bringing aircraft to market have struggled to raise funds for expansion, more so since the 2008 financial crash.

Chinese investors are not philanthropists offering a sentimental helping hand to cash-strapped aerospace brands. China's aerospace infrastructure lags far behind its demand for aviation products, and acquiring established businesses overseas is one way of importing that know-how into the domestic industry. The beneficiaries of this largesse are not complaining. Guttridge sums up what SLMR's takeover has meant for the once-ailing company:

""We would never have dreamed of giving ourselves a target of going from $200 million turnover to $1 billion in five years under a different ownership. We would have had no chance of expanding into a market that will represent 20% of the demand for all passenger aircraft in the next 20 years,"" he says. ""It has opened a huge door for us. It has moved us into a whole new era.""",Flight Global,1

The fuselage will be subjected to repetitive loading to simulate some 180,000 cycles.

Irkut

Both Irkut and the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute – which is already testing a static MC-21 airframe – will assemble the twinjet’s structure and fit the stress systems.

The fuselage was transported to Zhukovsky on 3 December using a Volga-Dnepr Antonov An-124-100 freighter (RA-82044).

“Endurance tests are conducted to confirm the design solutions in terms of fatigue strength and operational survivability,” says Irkut.

Irkut has assembled and completed systems installation on the third flight-test MC-21, and says the aircraft is undergoing “the final stage of adjustment”. The first two flight-test aircraft have been conducting trials at Moscow.

The airframer is also working on assembling a fourth aircraft, which will form part of the test fleet, and is bringing together fuselage sections for the first serial airframe.

Initial MC-21s are powered by the Pratt & Whitney PW1400G engine but Russian developers aim to test the twinjet with the domestically-built Aviadvigatel PD-14.

Irkut transferred the MC-21’s static test fuselage to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute in 2016.

"Boeing has flipped on the power to its first 777X test aircraft, a move that allows the company to progress with a broad array of systems tests prior to next year's planned first flight.

The company performed the power-up in early December at its site in Everett, where two flight-test 777Xs are in final assembly.

The power-up procedure occurs when airframes move to the final position in the assembly process and enables ""hundreds of functional tests"" to be performed, says Boeing.

The process does not include starting the 777X's GE Aviation GE9X engines.

Boeing's two 777X flight test aircraft – including the first aircraft expected to fly, at top – at the company's Everett assembly site.

Boeing switched on the electricity several weeks after it performed ""final body join"" on its first 777X test aircraft. That step involves mating the 777X's three main fuselage sections – nose, mid region and aft section.

Boeing joined the first 777X flight-test aircraft's three fuselage sections in November.

The test aircraft is scheduled for first flight in 2019, and Boeing expects to begin 777-9 deliveries in 2020. Boeing has orders for 316 777X, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer.

The 777-9 will be able to carry 400-425 passengers and will have a range of 7,600nm (14,075km), Boeing says. The 777-8, which will enter service after the 777-9, will be capable of carrying 350-375 passengers and will have an 8,700nm (16,110km) range, according to the company.

"Boeing has extended its relationship with UK composite specialist ELG Carbon Fibre to allow waste material from the airframer’s production to be routinely recycled.

The US manufacturer says that excess carbonfibre from 11 production sites will be processed for re-use by other industry sectors, for example, to make laptop cases and car parts.

Boeing intends to recycle more than 450t of carbonfibre a year and says that the partnership with ELG is “the first of its kind” in the aerospace sector.

The two partners have conducted an 18-month trial, during which around 172t of carbonfibre from Boeing's composite wing centre in Everett, near Seattle, was recycled and handed on to users in other sectors.

Boeing says that it had been working for several years on ways of recycling carbonfibre in an “economically viable” manner, and that it has improved its production methods to reduce the amount of waste material generated.

“[But] recycling cured carbonfibre was not possible just a few years ago,” states materials and fabrication director for product strategy and future airplane development Tia Benson Tolle.

ELG has developed a process during which carbonfibre structures are chopped up – to create a consistent size of particle – and then heated in a furnace to burn off the resin within the material.

The recycler’s managing director, Frazer Barnes, foresees that the partnership with Boeing with provide certainty for the supply of carbonfibre feedstock in order to establish a viable recycling business.

“Security of supply is extremely important when considering using these materials in long-term automotive and electronic projects,” Barnes states.

"Recaro has started in-house production of seat covers at a new facility in Poland and gained a contract from the country’s flag carrier LOT to supply seats for its Boeing 737 fleet.

The German manufacturer says that the seat cover sewing facility – dubbed “cut2dress” – is located in close proximity to its seat production facility in Swiebodzin.

While Recaro will continue using seat covers from external suppliers, the company says that the new facility enables it to set its “own standards in terms of workmanship”, will provide higher flexibility and shorten supply chain lead times.

Operating an owned sewing facility “increases [the manufacturer’s] influence on the visual quality and craftsmanship of the dress covers”, Recaro says.

Chief executive Mark Hiller states that the facility will generate additional growth and represents a step toward “better supporting our customers”.

LOT has ordered seats for nine 737s, with the first aircraft scheduled to be fitted with the new equipment during the first quarter of 2019.

"Subaru Aerospace Company has moved up the value chain with its center wing-box work for the Boeing 777X, as it seeks to further improve efficiency and manage costs.

Shoichiro Tozuka, president of Subaru’s aerospace unit, notes that the aluminum/titanium wing box that the company produces for the 777-8 and -9 is considerably heavier than that it builds for the legacy 777 programme.

“The 777X will carry more people and have a greater payload,” he says. “While its center wing-box is of similar size to that of the 777-300ER it is heavier with more reinforcement in the wings.”

FlightGlobal spoke with Tozuka recently in Tokyo.

The company’s new Handa facility completed the first 777X wing-box in February. In addition to producing the wing-box the company also joins it with the aircraft’s main landing gear wheel wells. Whereas with the legacy 777 the company produced what Tozuka calls a “blank box,” which still required additional work before the wing join, for the 777X it delivers a wing-box ready for wing attachment.

He adds that the new wing-box uses considerably more titanium than the previous 777 wing-box. “We use a lot of titanium parts, which we have experience with from 787 center wing-box production.”

While the composite 787 wing-box can be transported from Nagoya to Everett, Washington by the 747 Dreamlifter, 777 wing-boxes can only be transported by sea. Tozuka estimates that the wingbox is probably the single biggest item delivered to Boeing's production line.

Tozuka remarks that there is an ongoing work to improve efficiency, both within Subaru and through its supply chain. This involves regular “kaizen” workshops, which aim to improve the productivity of both Subaru and and suppliers.

“The focus is not just a specific process but the entire factory,” he says. It covers everything from raw materials, cutting, painting, riveting, shipping, and even what happens with leftover materials, such as valuable titanium tips.

“It's a long term activity between us and each supplier. We try to exchange information between each other, and also between suppliers so that we can level up the total power of the supply chain.”

When asked about whether Japan’s aerospace industry should be consolidated, Tozuka is dubious. He notes that there is already substantial cooperation between major players such Subaru, Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, and Shinmaywa on major programmes, particularly in the military space.

“In small production areas such as helicopters we can do it on our own, so sometimes we compete [with other Japanese aerospace firms], but for fighter aircraft, cargo airplanes, and big projects that require investment and programme risk, then you'd better share. We setup one company to join, and everyone gets together.”

In regard to futuristic programmes Subaru is very interested in airborne urban mobility. Tozuka points out that Subaru Aerospace Company has a strong pedigree in designing aerospace products and understands processes such as certification. This gibes well with Subaru’s car business, which has strong credentials in mass production and marketing private vehicles.",Flight Global,0
"BERLIN/MADRID (Reuters) - Germany and France will welcome Spain as a full partner in their programme to develop a next-generation air combat system, and expect to sign an agreement finalising the move at the Paris Air Show in June, German government sources said on Wednesday.

Paris and Berlin initially planned to offer Spain only observer status on the programme, but changed their plans after extensive discussions with Spanish officials, according to a separate source familiar with the matter.

Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles this week then formally asked to participate as a fully fledged partner in the programme, which will also require certain financial outlays.

“The current intention is to sign a tri-national memorandum of understanding on the sidelines of the 2019 Paris Air Show in Le Bourget,” said one of the German sources.

A spokesman for the German Defence Ministry welcomed Spain’s expression of interest, noting that it made sense to work jointly to put future programmes on a solid footing. Spain was also a partner in the earlier Eurofighter programme.

No comment was immediately available from the French Defence Ministry.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel first announced the ambitious weapons development programme in July 2017.

The two countries announced last month that they expected to sign initial contracts with Airbus and Dassault Aviation in early 2019 to move ahead with the new Future Combat Air System (FCAS), to include a jet fighter and a range of associated weapons, including drones.

Britain, which is due to exit the European Union in March 2019, unveiled its own rival aircraft development programme, dubbed Tempest, at the Farnborough Air Show in July.

European military and industry executives say they believe the two programmes could and should eventually be merged given the need to compete internationally and the many billions of euros needed to develop a new combat aircraft.

Robles said her ministry was “convinced that these programmes will eventually merge,” adding: “Despite this, and with the aim of participating in the project from its initial phase, Spain has decided to join Paris and Berlin’s project.”",Reuters,0
"The UK government has committed funding of up to £125 million ($159 million) for future aerospace technology projects as part of a wider agreement to boost the sector.

Provided through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, the government investment is to be matched by industry partners and will be used for a programme dubbed Future Flight Challenge, to support new technology developments including electric aircraft, drones and urban air mobility vehicles.

Additionally, the aerospace sector deal foresees support of small- and medium-sized UK suppliers to “boost their competitiveness”, the government says in the published agreement.

Some £10m - in addition to the future technology initiative and again matched by industry - has been earmarked for a productivity improvement scheme named “Supply Chain 21 Competitive and Growth”.

The agreement includes a charter to boost the number of women and, generally, to “increase diversity and inclusion in the sector”.

Co-operation between industry, universities and other training providers is to be enhanced to ensure a “strong future pipeline of talented people” for the sector.

As part of that effort, the UK’s National Aerospace Technology Exploitation Programme – aimed at boosting research and development projects led by small- and medium-sized enterprises – will be expanded with an additional £13.7 million of government funding and £10 million from industry partners.

The government says that it has an “ambition” to gradually increase research and development spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% over the “longer term”.

The aerospace sector deal follows prime minister Theresa May’s announcement at Farnborough air show in July that her government would work with industry partners to position the sector for the future.

UK aerospace trade association ADS has welcomed the agreement. “A strong long-term partnership between government and industry is essential for UK aerospace to meet the challenges of global competition and new market opportunities,” says chief executive Paul Everitt.

"A federal court in Brazil has issued an injunction to stop the proposed commercial aviation joint venture between Embraer and Boeing, following a lawsuit filed against the deal by four lawmakers in Brazil.

The judge who granted the injunction says that Embraer would be giving up its profitable commercial aviation business if it embarks on the deal with Boeing, says a Reuters report.

Embraer says it will seek to overturn the injunction. It calls the injunction a ""provisional measure to suspend the effects"" of an eventual decision by Embraer's board to approve the Boeing tie-up.

The injunction does not impose ""any kind of obstacles to the continuance of the negotiations between both companies"", says Embraer.

Boeing declines to comment when contacted by FlightGlobal.

The injunction could further hold up the process for the approval of the proposed joint venture, which was officially announced in July.

Embraer had previously said it planned to secure Brazil government approval for the partnership within the current administration of Brazil president Michel Temer, whose term ends on 31 December. Brazil President-elect Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly supportive of the planned partnership between the two companies.

While previous reports have said that Embraer will finalise talks with Boeing by 5 December, the Brazilian company subsequently said it could not specify a deadline for when talks would conclude.

Embraer has said that it plans to close the deal with Boeing by end-2019.

Under the proposed tie-up, Boeing will purchase an 80% share of Embraer's commercial aircraft business for $3.8 billion, leaving Embraer with the remaining 20%. Brazil's government, which has a golden share in Embraer, has the right to veto the deal.

"GKN Aerospace has revealed a plan to establish a research and technology facility in Bristol which, together with external partners, will focus on development of future aerostructures.

The UK-headquartered manufacturer says it has committed £17 million ($22 million) to the Global Technology Centre, with the UK government contributing a further £15 million. The facility is scheduled to open in 2020.

Designed to accommodate around 300 engineers, the centre will concentrate on additive manufacturing, advanced composites, component assembly and digital industrial processes to enable “high-rate” production of aircraft structures, GKN says.

It adds that the site will serve as GKN’s base for Airbus’s “Wings of Tomorrow” technology programme.

GKN is a key supplier for current Airbus programmes, and in 2008 acquired from the European airframer extensive manufacturing operations in Filton, outside Bristol.

Research and technology activities at the new facility will be conducted in collaboration with mainly UK-based suppliers, universities, and participants in the country’s industrial innovation programme “Catapult”.

Among the 15 partners are the UK’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre; The Manufacturing Technology Centre; Thales; robotics specialist Kuka Industries, and the nearby universities of Bristol and Bath.

GKN chief executive Hans Buthker tells FlightGlobal that new technology development is essential for the company to be able to attract supply contracts on future aircraft programmes. “If you don’t have new technology, you won’t be on the next platform,” he says.

The new facility is central to supporting GKN’s 4,000-strong UK workforce, he adds.

The manufacturer already has technology centres at locations in the Netherlands, Sweden and the USA, but the Bristol facility will be GKN’s largest R&D site.

Noting the facility’s public funding under the UK government’s newly-revealed aerospace industry strategy, Buthker says the government has adopted a “much more aggressive” approach than in the past to support the sector.

He adds that, in his view, the UK government shows an “ambition to outperform other countries” in terms of industrial support.

“We look forward to working with the British government in the years to come,” he says.

Secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy Greg Clark says the new facility will “keep the UK at the forefront of the latest technologies and manufacturing processes for the next-generation of aircraft”.

Buthker says that GKN’s new shareholder Melrose Industries – the turnaround specialist acquired the manufacturer in April – is “really supportive” of the company’s efforts to develop new technology and establish the Bristol facility.

He says that GKN’s relations with Melrose are “good” and that his priority since the acquisition has been to improve the manufacturer’s US operations – which, he adds, are making “good progress”.",Flight Global,1
"Bombardier's commercial aircraft unit will remain in the red next year but turn a profit in 2020, at which time the company expects to have completed the sale of its Dash 8 turboprop programme, Bombardier says in a financial update.

The Montreal-based airframer also anticipates strong growth in the coming years from both its business jet and aerostructures divisions.

The latest update comes one month after Bombardier announced a plan to sell the Dash 8 programme, which includes the Q400 turboprop, to an affiliate of Vancouver-based Viking Air for $300 million.

That move follows Bombardier's July sale of majority CSeries ownership to Airbus and reflects Bombardier's intention to focus less on commercial aviation, chief executive Alaine Bellemare said in November.

He added that ""strategic options"" remain open for the CRJ – Bombardier's only other commercial aircraft programme – signaling to some analysts that Bombardier will divest that aircraft next.

Bombardier released its latest financial predictions amid such variables.

It anticipates its commercial aircraft unit will deliver about 35 aircraft in 2019 and generate $1.4 billion in revenue. The unit will still lose about $125 million (before taxes, interest payments and special item expenses) next year, it states.

In 2020, however, the unit will turn profitable, according to the update. Bombardier does not, however, provide specific 2020 revenue or profit figures, citing the planned Dash 8 sale and ""the exploration strategic options of the CRJ"".

Bombardier has high hopes for its other aerospace divisions.

The company expects its business aircraft unit will deliver 150-155 aircraft in 2019, earn $6.25 billion in revenue and turn a profit margin of 7.5%. The business aircraft division's profit margin will climb to 8-10% in 2020, Bombardier predicts.

The company expects its aerostructures and engineering unit will generate $2 billion of revenue in 2019 and a 9% profit margin, followed in 2020 by at least $2.25 billion in revenue and a 9-11% profit margin, Bombardier says.

Airbus handed over 11 A350s including three -1000 variants – two to Cathay Pacific and one to Qatar Airways.

These took the overall number of A350s delivered this year to 81, of which 69 were -900s and 12 were -1000s.

"First delivery of the A330neo has brought with it a period of anxious waiting in Toulouse, as Airbus hopes for a smooth service entry from the twinjet.

Delays to the handover of the first example have already taken the shine off the programme, and left orders some way short of the airframer’s target.

Former sales chief John Leahy once confidently predicted that Airbus would sell more than 1,000 of the re-engined widebodies. Despite his departure, the airframer is sticking to that distant aim.

Airbus’s own marketing efforts are partly to blame for the lack lustre sales performance, having lauded the development for its simplicity, rather than its modernity. But recently there seems to have been a change in tone from the airframer, which now talks about the A330neo in the same breath as the A350, as part of a “new-­generation twin-aisle family”.

Perhaps this is an acknowledgement that perception issues are hampering sales of the Neo.

But with the replacement cycle for current A330s still several years away, it is vital for Airbus to shed the “old technology” image, lest it take deeper root.

"BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - Chinese-owned Irish leasing company Avolon firmed up its largest ever purchase on Friday with an order for 100 Airbus (AIR.PA) jets worth $11.5 billion (9.01 billion pounds) at list prices, lifting the covers off a deal struck in the face of global trade tensions.

Reuters reported in July that Chinese financial firms had placed large orders at the Farnborough Airshow without initially being identified, including Avolon’s preliminary order for 100 jets that has now been finalised and made public.

Airbus’s then sales chief Eric Schulz said at the time some Asian buyers were asking not to be named due to sensitivities over trade tensions between China and the United States.

Although Europe’s Airbus has not reaped the benefit some had predicted from the standoff - with its own direct sale of jets to China blocked for almost a year - finance sources say China-linked firms have generally been keeping a low profile in order not to be caught on the wrong side of the shifting dispute.

Avolon was not immediately available for comment.

In a statement, China’s Bohai Leasing Co Ltd (000415.SZ), controlled by conglomerate HNA Group, said its Dublin-based Avolon Aerospace Leasing unit had signed a firm deal to buy 75 Airbus A320neo jets and 25 of the larger A321neos.

The aircraft will be delivered between 2023 and 2026.

The deal underscores Avolon’s continued expansion despite financial difficulties faced by the HNA group of companies.

Avolon has been forced to put distance between itself and its ultimate parent, telling investors earlier this year that it would be impossible to milk the aircraft leasing firm for cash to prop up the cash-pinched Chinese conglomerate.

In August, Japanese financial services group Orix Corp (8591.T) struck a $2.2 billion deal to buy a 30 percent stake in Avolon Holdings as HNA Group trimmed holdings in core assets.

Avolon’s founder and chief executive, Domhnal Slattery, said in Friday’s statement that the scale of the Airbus order reflected the “long-term commitment and strategic perspective of our shareholders.”

Asked last week whether HNA’s Bohai intended to sell more shares in Avolon or whether Avolon would seek to open its capital further, Slattery told Reuters “not at the moment”.

Avolon is expanding to meet what it sees as robust demand for aircraft despite concerns among some analysts that an extended commercial aviation cycle is softening.

In November last year, Avolon placed an order for 75 competing Boeing 737 MAX airplanes worth $8.7 billion at list prices and said it may order 20 more.

Last week Avolon facilitated the first delivery of an upgraded Airbus A330neo airliner to TAP Portugal.",Reuters,0

"European safety regulators have permitted Rolls-Royce a temporary deviation from requirements to comply fully with certification criteria, while it continues investigating blade cracking on the Trent 1000.

The European Aviation Safety Agency has set out conditions for the deviation – which relates to high-cycle fatigue endurance – including requiring a proposed timescale for restoring full compliance with the certification standard.

EASA states that several occurrences have been observed in which high-cycle fatigue led to compressor blade cracking, and cracking in the compressor drum.

While inspection regimes have been implemented to ensure airworthiness, EASA says the initiation of cracking is “normally not in line” with the engine certification criteria which demand high-cycle fatigue life.

Rolls-Royce has proposed to EASA, however, that it can meet an equivalent level of safety if it can demonstrate that the crack initiation and propagation mechanisms are sufficiently understood to claim that they will not result in component failure.

This demonstration will be achieved through implementing repeat inspections, backed by its experience in engine testing, analytical modelling, and fractography.

Rolls-Royce has informed EASA that these capabilities provide a level of understanding adequate to “underwrite a conservative inspection programme”.

EASA has responded that Rolls-Royce must use its capabilities to show it fully understands sequences of multiple failure modes, including crack initiation and propagation, and use “sufficient conservatism” to prevent any in-service component failure.

It has detailed the measures on which the temporary deviation depends, adding that the manufacturer will substantiate that – despite the “expected” initiation of cracks in the compressor blades and drum during service – an “adequate and fully justified” service-management plan will ensure that none of these cracks will result in failure.

Incoming president Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly supportive of the planned partnership between the two companies.

The two companies plan to close the deal by end-2019. Under the proposed tie-up, Boeing will purchase an 80% share of Embraer's commercial aircraft business for $3.8 billion, leaving Embraer with the remaining 20%.",Flight Global,0
"GE Aviation's GE9X turbofan returned to the skies on 10 December, kicking off a second round of airborne testing during which the engine maker will evaluate the powerplant's software and performance in hot-and-high conditions.

The latest round of testing will involve roughly 18 flights on GE's flying Boeing 747-400 testbed, which will carry the massive GE9X turbofan under its wing, GE says.

The 105,000lb-thrust (467kN) GE9X will power Boeing's 777X.

GE9X flight tests will stretch into the first quarter of next year, bringing GE closer to achieving its goal of receiving in 2019 certification of the engine by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the Ohio-based engine maker.

""During the second round of testing, GE will continue software development testing that began in the first round, perform hot-and-high starts and fill in remaining gaps from the first round of testing,"" says GE.

GE's GE9X turbofan goes to work on the wing of the company's 747-400 flying testbed.

GE Aviation.

The company's first round of GE9X airborne testing was delayed more than two months earlier this year after engineers discovered unexpected wear on ""lever arms"" that alter the pitch of vanes inside the engine's compressor.

The engine finally got airborne in March when GE began an initial round of airborne tests that lasted until early May. That round involved 18 flights and 105h of flight time, allowing GE to study high-altitude performance and to compare performance during cruise to ground-test data, GE has told FlightGlobal.

With the initial round complete, the company transported the test engine to Ohio, where it was modified into the final configuration expected for production, GE says.

""The engine is more than halfway through the certification testing programme and [has] completed various tests during the last few months,"" GE says.

Those tests have included evaluation of performance during water ingestion, overheating and crosswinds, it says.

""Tests that remain include blade out, hailstone, bird ingestion and block or endurance testing,"" GE says.

The GE9X-105B variant of the engine will power the 777-9, which Boeing expects will achieve first flight in 2019 and enter service in 2020.

GE also plans to develop versions of the turbofan with 102,000lb-thrust and 93,000lb-thrust, according to regulatory filings with the FAA. Those engines could power other 777X variants.

GE operates a flight test center in Victorville, California, but also performs airborne testing from Colorado Springs in Colorado, Seattle, Fairbanks in Alaska and Yuma in Arizona, it says.

The company acquired its 747-400 flying testbed from Japan Air Lines, then modified and strengthened the aircraft's wing and strut to accommodate test engines, it says.",Flight Global,0

"Mitsubishi Aircraft's Japan-based engine-manufacturing affiliate has completed its first assembly of a Pratt & Whitney PW1200G turbofan, another milestone along Mitsubishi Aircraft's journey toward beginning full-scale MRJ production.

The engine, assembled by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aero Engines (MHIAEL) in a facility outside Nagoya, has since passed P&W's production acceptance examination and will now enter the MRJ flight-testing programme, says P&W in a media release.

P&W developed the PW1000G line of geared turbofans, but partnered with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to help manufacture and assemble the MRJ's PW1200G. News broke in July that MHIAEL has started assembling the first PW1200G.

Mitsubishi's aero engine unit is now constructing a PW1200G test and production assembly site in the Nagoya suburb of Komaki, which will be one of two global PW1200G assembly sites, the release says.

The other is P&W's facility in the Canadian city of Mirabel, near Montreal.

MHIAEL is still working toward obtaining certification from the Federal Aviation Administration for its Komaki facility, says P&W.

“We’re gearing up intensely as we prepare for production by building the capacities and expertise we need to perform this critical work,"" MHIAEL chief executive Katsuyuki Shimauchi says of his company's PW1200G work.

The FAA certified the PW1200G in 2017. The MRJ remains in flight testing, and Mitsubishi Aircraft anticipates delivering the first aircraft – an MRJ90 variant – in 2020, it says.

P&W did not immediately respond to questions about how many PW1200Gs MHIAEL will assemble, or about when the Komaki shop might receive FAA certification.

MHIAEL also manufactures PW1200G combustors, high-pressure turbine disks and diffusor cases, and components for other commercial aircraft engines made by P&W, International Aero Engines and Rolls-Royce, its website says.",Flight Global,0
"Latin American budget carrier Viva Air has selected Teledyne Controls to provide hardware and software to collect aircraft data and distribute on-board system software updates across a fleet of Airbus A320 jets.

Teledyne says that a total 50 A320neo and -ceo jets will be forward-fitted with the wireless data loading technology.

The equipment suite for each aircraft will comprise the US supplier’s Flight Data Interface and Management Unit (FDIMU) software to facilitate aircraft condition monitoring, a quick access recorder, and Loadstar Server Enterprise and Airborne Data Loader programs that enable operators to upload and distribute software updates across the aircraft.

Teledyne says that the solutions will increase the speed of updating aircraft software – including on board navigation databases – and “streamline” maintenance processes.

The IT package “ensures that the latest version of software is installed, while reducing data loading time and eliminating the need to reproduce, distribute and load countless floppy disks each month”, Teledyne says.

It adds: “This keeps human intervention to a minimum and gives operators the ability to load their aircraft at multiple hubs.”

Teledyne says Viva Air is the first airline in the region to benefit from the technology.

"Mitsubishi is to acquire a 25% shareholding in UK composite recycling company ELG Carbon Fibre from its German parent, the metals-reprocessing specialist ELG Haniel.

The Japanese industrial conglomerate will purchase the stake through its trading arm Mitsubishi Corporation, which is active across sectors as diverse as chemicals, energy, finance, foods, machinery, metals, and environmental activities.

""By uniting [ELG's] advanced technology and proficiency in the metals reprocessing industry and Mitsubishi Corporation's global network and broad interface with different industries, the companies aim to enhance the global business development and reliable supply of reprocessed carbonfibre,"" ELG says.

The company, based near Birmingham, has developed a recycling process in partnership with Boeing and disclosed earlier this month a deal under which waste material from the US airframer's production will be routinely reprocessed.

ELG describes itself as ""the first company in the world to have established stable commercial production of reprocessed carbonfibre"" and says that the material will be used in the automotive and electronics industries.

Noting that carmakers are seeking ""lightweight advanced material solutions"", ELG adds: ""Whilst Japan is a global leader in carbonfibre technology, producing almost 70% of the world's supply, recycling technologies have not developed at the same pace and Mitsubishi Corporation's partnership with [ELG] addresses this important barrier to mass adoption"".
